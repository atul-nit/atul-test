    <p>At some point a longer list will become a List of Great Mathematicians\nrather than a List of Great<i><b>est</b></i>
        Mathematicians.\nI\'ve expanded my original List of Thirty to an even Hundred, but you may prefer to\nreduce it
        to a Top Seventy, Top Sixty, Top Fifty, Top Forty or\nTop Thirty list, or even Top Twenty, Top Fifteen or Top
        Ten List.\n
    <p>Newton contributed little to number theory, and satisfies the "great breadth"\nrequirement due to his huge
        contributions to physics.\nAs my knowledge of the history of mathematics grows I often revise the\nrankings in
        this list, <i>but by this time I\'m reluctant to make\nmajor changes at the very top.</i>\nWithout this
        reluctance I might demote Newton, though he\'d still be in the Top Five.\n

                <blockquote>\nLittle is known of the earliest mathematics, but the famous\n<i>Ishango Bone</i> from
                    Early Stone-Age Africa has tally marks suggesting\narithmetic. The markings include six prime
                    numbers (5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)\nin order, though this is probably coincidence.\n\n
            <p>The advanced artifacts of Egypt\'s Old Kingdom\nand the Indus-Harrapa civilization\nimply strong
                mathematical skill, but the first\nwritten evidence of advanced arithmetic dates from Sumeria,\nwhere
                4500-year old clay tablets show multiplication and\ndivision problems; the first abacus may be about
                this old.\nBy 3600 years ago, Mesopotamian tablets show\ntables of squares, cubes, reciprocals, and even
                logarithms\nand trig functions,\nusing a primitive place-value system (in base 60, not 10).\nBabylonians
                were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem,\nsolutions to quadratic equations,\neven cubic equations
                (though they didn\'t have a general solution for these),\nand eventually even developed methods to
                estimate\nterms for compound interest.\nThe Greeks borrowed from Babylonian mathematics, which was the
                most\nadvanced of any before the Greeks; but there is no\nancient Babylonian mathematician whose name is
                known.\n\n
            <p>Also at least 3600 years ago, the Egyptian scribe Ahmes\nproduced a famous manuscript\n(now called the
                <i>Rhind Papyrus</i>),\nitself a copy of a late Middle Kingdom text.\nIt showed simple algebra methods
                and\nincluded a table giving optimal\nexpressions using Egyptian fractions.\n(Today, Egyptian fractions
                lead to challenging number theory\nproblems with no practical applications, but they may have\nhad
                practical value for the Egyptians.\nTo divide 17 grain bushels among 21 workers, the\nequation 17/21 =
                1/2 + 1/6 + 1/7 has practical value,\nespecially when compared with\nthe "greedy" decomposition\n17/21 =
                1/2 + 1/4 + 1/17 + 1/1428.)\n\n
            <p>The Pyramids demonstrate that Egyptians\nwere adept at geometry, though little written evidence
                survives.\nBabylon was much more advanced than Egypt at arithmetic and algebra;\nthis was probably due,
                at least in part, to their place-value system.\nBut although their base-60 system survives (e.g. in the
                division\nof hours and degrees into minutes and seconds) the Babylonian\nnotation, which used the
                equivalent of IIIIII XXXXXIIIIIII XXXXIII\nto denote 417+43/60, was unwieldy compared to the\n"ten
                digits of the Hindus."\n(In 2016 historians were surprised to decode ancient Babylonian\ntexts and find
                very sophisticated astronomical calculations\nof Jupiter\'s orbit.)\n\n
            <p>The Egyptians used the approximation\n<b>&pi; &asymp; (4/3)<sup>4</sup></b>\n(derived from the idea that
                a\ncircle of diameter 9 has about the same area as a square of side 8).\nAlthough the ancient Hindu
                mathematician Apastambha had achieved\na good approximation for <b>&radic;2</b>, and the ancient
                Babylonians\nan ever better <b>&radic;2</b>, neither of these ancient\ncultures achieved a <i>&pi;</i>
                approximation as good as Egypt\'s,\nor better than <b>&pi; &asymp; 25/8</b>, until the Alexandrian
                era.\n\n
            <p>The sudden blossoming of math in the Iron Ages of India and\nGreece owes much to the ancient mathematics
                of Egypt and Babylonia. \n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>The greatest mathematics before the\nGolden Age of Greece was in India\'s\nearly Vedic
                    (Hindu) civilization.\nThe Vedics understood relationships between geometry\nand arithmetic,
                    developed astronomy, astrology, calendars,\nand used mathematical forms in some religious
                    rituals.\n\n
            <p>The earliest mathematician to whom definite teachings can be ascribed\nwas Lagadha, who apparently lived
                about 1300 BC and\nused geometry and elementary trigonometry for his astronomy.\nBaudhayana lived about
                800 BC and also wrote on algebra and geometry;\nYajnavalkya lived about the same time and is credited
                with the then-best\napproximation to <b>&pi;</b>.\nApastambha did work summarized below;\nother early
                Vedic mathematicians solved quadratic and simultaneous equations.\n\n
            <p>Other early cultures also developed some mathematics.\nThe ancient Mayans apparently had a place-value
                system\nwith zero before the Hindus did;\nAztec architecture implies practical geometry skills.\nAncient
                China certainly developed mathematics,\nin fact the first known proof of the Pythagorean Theorem\nis
                found in a Chinese book (<i>Zhoubi Suanjing</i>)\nwhich <i>might</i> have been written about 1000
                BC.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Thales was the Chief of the "Seven Sages" of ancient Greece,\nand has been called the
                    "Father of Science,"\nthe "Founder of Abstract Geometry,"\nand the "First Philosopher."\nThales is
                    believed to have studied mathematics\nunder Egyptians, who in turn were aware of much
                    older\nmathematics from Mesopotamia.\nThales may have invented the notion of
                    compass-and-straightedge\nconstruction.\nSeveral fundamental theorems about triangles\nare
                    attributed to Thales, including the law of similar triangles\n(which Thales used famously to
                    calculate the height of the Great Pyramid)\nand "Thales\' Theorem" itself: the fact that any angle
                    inscribed in\na semicircle is a right angle.\n(The other "theorems" were probably more like
                    well-known axioms,\nbut Thales proved Thales\' Theorem using two of\nhis other theorems; it is said
                    that Thales then sacrificed\nan ox to celebrate what might have been the first\nmathematical proof
                    in Greece.)\nThales noted that, given a line segment\nof length <i>x</i>, a segment of length
                    <i>x/k</i> can be constructed\nby first constructing a segment of length <i>kx</i>.\n\n
            <p>Thales was also an astronomer; he invented the 365-day calendar,\nintroduced the use of Ursa Minor for
                finding North,\ninvented the gnomonic map projection (the first of many\nmethods known today to map
                (part of) the surface of a sphere\nto a plane,\nand is the first person believed to have correctly
                predicted a solar eclipse.\nHis theories of physics would seem quaint today, but he\nseems to have been
                the first to describe magnetism and static electricity.\nAristotle said, "To Thales the primary question
                was\nnot what do we know, but how do we know it."\nThales was also a politician, ethicist, and military
                strategist.\nIt is said he once leased all available olive presses\nafter predicting a good olive
                season; he did this not\nfor the wealth itself, but as a demonstration of the use\nof intelligence in
                business.\nThales\' writings have not survived and are known only second-hand.\nSince his famous
                theorems of geometry were probably already known\nin ancient Babylon, his importance derives from
                imparting the\nnotions of mathematical proof and the scientific method\nto ancient Greeks.\nWhile more
                ancient mathematicians were concerned with practical\ncalculations, modern mathematics began with the
                Greek emphasis\non proofs and philosophy. Pythagoras and Parmenides of Elea also\nplayed key roles in
                that development which began with Thales.\nThese ideas led to the schools of Plato, Aristotle and
                Euclid,\nand an intellectual blossoming unequaled until\nEurope\'s Renaissance.\n\n
            <p>Thales\' student and successor was Anaximander, who is often called\nthe "First Scientist" instead of
                Thales: his theories were more\nfirmly based on experimentation and logic, while Thales still\nrelied on
                some animistic interpretations.\nAnaximander is famous for astronomy, cartography and sundials,\nand
                also enunciated a theory of evolution, that land species\nsomehow developed from primordial
                fish!\nAnaximander\'s most famous student, in turn, was Pythagoras.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>The <i> Dharmasutra</i> composed by Apastambha contains mensuration\ntechniques, novel
                    geometric construction techniques, a method of elementary\nalgebra, and what may be an early proof
                    of the Pythagorean Theorem.\nApastambha\'s work uses the excellent (continued
                    fraction)\napproximation <b>&radic;2\n&asymp; 577/408</b>, a result probably derived with\na
                    geometric argument.\n\n
            <p>Apastambha built on the work of earlier Vedic scholars,\nespecially Baudhayana, as well\nas Harappan and
                (probably) Mesopotamian mathematicians.\nHis notation and proofs were primitive, and there is
                little\ncertainty about his life.\nHowever similar comments apply to Thales of Miletus, so it
                seems\nfair to mention Apastambha (who was perhaps the\nmost creative Vedic mathematician before
                Panini)\nalong with Thales as one of the\nearliest mathematicians whose name is known.\n</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Pythagoras, who is sometimes called the "First Philosopher,"\nstudied under Anaximander,
                    Egyptians, Babylonians,\nand the mystic Pherekydes (from whom\nPythagoras acquired a belief in
                    reincarnation); he became\nthe most influential of early Greek mathematicians.\nHe is credited with
                    being first to use axioms\nand deductive proofs, so his influence on Plato and Euclid may be
                    enormous;\nhe is generally credited with much of\nBooks I and II of Euclid\'s <i>Elements</i>.\nHe
                    and his students (the "Pythagoreans") were ascetic mystics\nfor whom mathematics was partly a
                    spiritual tool.\n(Some occultists treat Pythagoras as a wizard and founding
                    mystic\nphilosopher.)\nPythagoras was very interested in astronomy and seems to have been the\nfirst
                    man to realize that the Earth was a globe similar to the other planets.\nHe and his followers began
                    to study the question of planetary motions,\nwhich would not be resolved for more than two
                    millennia.\nThe words <i>philosophy</i> and <i>mathematics</i> are said to have\nbeen coined by
                    Pythagoras.\nHe is supposed to have invented the <i>Pythagorean Cup</i>, a clever\nwine goblet which
                    punishes a drinker who greedily fills his cup to the top\nby then using siphon pressure to drain the
                    cup.\n\n
            <p>Despite Pythagoras\' historical importance I may have ranked him too high:\nmany results of the
                Pythagoreans were\ndue to his students; none of their writings survive; and what\nis known is reported
                second-hand, and possibly\nexaggerated, by Plato and others.\nSome ideas attributed to him were probably
                first enunciated by successors\nlike Parmenides of Elea (ca 515-440 BC).\nArchaeologists now believe
                that he was not first to invent the diatonic\nscale: <a\nhref="http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/the-oldest-song-in-the-world.html">\nHere
                is a diatonic-scale song from Ugarit</a>\nwhich predates Pythagoras by eight centuries.\n
            <p>Pythagoras\' students included Hippasus of Metapontum,\nthe famous anatomist and physician Alcmaeon
                (who\nwas first to claim that thinking occurred in the brain rather than heart),\nMilo of Croton,\nand
                Milo\'s daughter Theano (who may have been Pythagoras\'s wife).\nThe term <i>Pythagorean</i> was also
                adopted by many disciples who lived later;\nthese disciples include Philolaus of Croton,\nthe natural
                philosopher Empedocles, and several other famous Greeks.\nPythagoras\' successor was apparently Theano
                herself:\nthe Pythagoreans were one of the few ancient schools\nto practice gender equality.\n\n
            <p>Pythagoras discovered that harmonious intervals in music are based on\nsimple rational numbers.\nThis led
                to a fascination with integers\nand mystic numerology;\nhe is sometimes called the "Father of
                Numbers"\nand once said "Number rules the universe."\n(About the mathematical basis of music, Leibniz
                later wrote,\n"Music is the pleasure the human soul experiences from counting\nwithout being aware that
                it is counting."\nOther mathematicians who investigated the arithmetic\nof music included Huygens, Euler
                and Simon Stevin.)\nGiven any numbers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> the Pythagoreans were aware\nof the three
                distinct means:\n<b>(a+b)/2</b> (arithmetic mean),\n<b>&radic;(ab)</b> (geometric mean), and\n<b>2ab/(a+b)</b>
                (harmonic mean).\n\n
            <p>The Pythagorean Theorem was known long before Pythagoras,\nbut he was often credited (before discovery of
                an ancient Chinese text)\nwith the first <i>proof</i>.\nHe may have discovered the simple parametric
                form\nof primitive Pythagorean triplets <b>(xx-yy, 2xy, xx+yy)</b>,\nalthough the first explicit mention
                of this may be in Euclid\'s <i>Elements</i>.\nOther discoveries of the Pythagorean school include
                the\nconstruction of the regular pentagon,\nconcepts of perfect and amicable numbers,\npolygonal
                numbers,\ngolden ratio (attributed to Theano),\nthree of the five regular solids (attributed to
                Pythagoras himself),\nand irrational numbers (attributed to Hippasus).\nIt is said that the
                discovery\nof irrational numbers upset the Pythagoreans so much\nthey tossed Hippasus into the
                ocean!\n(Another version has Hippasus banished for revealing\nthe secret for constructing the sphere
                which circumscribes\na dodecahedron.)\n\n
            <p>In addition to Parmenides, the famous successors of Thales and Pythagoras\ninclude Zeno of Elea (see
                below),\nHippocrates of Chios (see below),\nPlato of Athens (ca 428-348 BC),\nTheaetetus (see below),
                and Archytas (see below).\nThese early Greeks ushered in a Golden Age of Mathematics\nand
                Philosophy\nunequaled in Europe until the Renaissance.\nThe emphasis was on pure, rather than practical,
                mathematics.\nPlato (who ranks #40 on Michael Hart\'s famous list of\nthe Most Influential Persons in
                History)\ndecreed that his scholars should do\ngeometric construction solely with compass and
                straight-edge\nrather than with "carpenter\'s tools" like\nrulers and protractors.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    the 20th century.\nLinguistics may seem an unlikely qualification for a "great mathematician,"\nbut
                    language theory is a field of mathematics.\nThe works of eminent 20th-century linguists and computer
                    scientists\nlike Chomsky, Backus, Post and Church\nare seen to resemble Panini\'s work 25 centuries

                    science and algebra.\nPanini has been called "the Indian Euclid" since the rigor\nof his grammar is

                    continues to the present-day, is largely due to\nhis paradoxes of infinitesimals, e.g. his
                    argument\nthat Achilles can never catch the tortoise (whenever Achilles arrives\nat the tortoise\'s
                    last position, the tortoise has moved on).\nAlthough some regard these paradoxes as simple
                    fallacies,\nthey have been contemplated for many centuries.\nIt is due to these paradoxes that\nthe
                    use of infinitesimals, which provides the basis for mathematical analysis,\nhas been regarded as a
                    non-rigorous heuristic and\nis finally viewed as sound only after the work of the
                    great\n19th-century rigorists, Dedekind and Weierstrass.\nZeno\'s Arrow Paradox (at any single
                    instant an arrow is at a fixed\nposition, so where does its motion come from?) has lent its name
                    to\nthe Quantum Zeno Effect, a paradox of quantum physics.\n
            <p>Eubulides of Miletus\nwas another ancient Greek famous for paradoxes,\ne.g. "This statement is a lie" --
                the sort of inconsistency\nlater used in proofs by G&ouml;del and Turing.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Hippocrates (no known relation to Hippocrates of Cos,\nthe famous physician)\nwrote his own
                    <i>Elements</i> more than\na century before Euclid. Only fragments survive but it\napparently used
                    axiomatic-based proofs similar to Euclid\'s\nand contains many of the same theorems. Hippocrates is
                    said to\nhave invented the <i>reductio ad absurdem</i> proof method.\nHippocrates is most famous for
                    his work on the three ancient\ngeometric quandaries: his work on cube-doubling\n(the <i>Delian
                        Problem</i>) laid the groundwork\nfor successful efforts by Archytas and others;\nand some claim
                    Hippocrates was first to trisect the general angle.\nHis circle quadrature was of course ultimately
                    unsuccessful but\nhe did prove ingenious theorems about "lunes" (crescent-shaped\ncircle
                    fragments).\nFor example, the area of any right triangle is equal to the\nsum of the areas of the
                    two lunes formed when semi-circles\nare drawn on each of the three edges of the
                    triangle.\nHippocrates also did work in algebra and rudimentary analysis.\n
            <p>(Doubling the cube and angle trisection are often called\n"impossible," but they are impossible only when
                restricted to\ncollapsing compass and unmarkable straightedge.\nThere are ingenious solutions available
                with other tools.\nConstruction of the regular heptagon is another such task,\nwith solutions published

                <blockquote>Archytas was an important statesman as well\nas philosopher. He studied under Philolaus of
                    Croton,\nwas a friend of Plato, and tutored Eudoxus.\nIn addition to discoveries always attributed
                    to him,\nhe may be the source of several of Euclid\'s theorems,\nand some works attributed to
                    Eudoxus and perhaps Pythagoras.\nRecently it has been shown that the magnificent <i>Mechanical
                        Problems</i>\nattributed to (pseudo-)Aristotle were probably actually written\nby Archytas,
                    making him one of the greatest mathematicians\nof antiquity.\n
            <p>Archytas introduced "motion" to geometry, rotating curves to\nproduce solids.\nIf his writings had
                survived he\'d surely be considered one\nof the most brilliant and innovative geometers of
                antiquity.\nHe appears on Cardano\'s List of 12 Greatest Geniuses.\n(Euclid, Aristotle, Archimedes,
                Apollonius, Ptolemy,\nand the physician Galen of Pergamum\nare the other Greeks on that
                List.)\nArchytas\' most famous mathematical achievement was\n"doubling the cube" (constructing a line
                segment larger than\nanother by the factor cube-root of two).\nAlthough others solved the problem
                with\nother techniques, Archytas\' solution for cube doubling was astounding because\nit wasn\'t
                achieved in the plane, but involved the intersection\nof three-dimensional bodies.\nThis construction
                (which introduced the <i>Archytas Curve</i>)\nhas been called "a tour de force of the spatial
                imagination."\nHe invented the term <i>harmonic mean</i> and worked with geometric means\nas well
                (proving that consecutive integers never have rational geometric mean).\nHe was a true polymath: he
                advanced the theory of music far beyond Pythagoras;\nstudied sound, optics and cosmology;\ninvented the
                pulley (and a rattle to occupy infants); wrote about\nthe lever; developed the curriculum called
                quadrivium;\nis credited with inventing the screw;\nand is supposed to have built a steam-powered wooden
                bird which\nflew for 200 meters.\nArchytas is sometimes called the "Father of Mathematical Mechanics."\n
            <p>Some scholars think Pythagoras and Thales are\npartly mythical. If we take that view, Archytas (and
                Hippocrates)\nshould be promoted in this list.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Eudoxus journeyed widely for his education,\ndespite that he was not wealthy,\nstudying
                    mathematics with Archytas in Tarentum,\nmedicine with Philiston in Sicily,\nphilosophy with Plato in
                    Athens,\ncontinuing his mathematics study in Egypt,\ntouring the Eastern Mediterranean with his own
                    students\nand finally returned to Cnidus where he established himself\nas astronomer, physician, and
                    ethicist.\nWhat is known of him is second-hand, through the writings\nof Euclid and others, but he
                    was one\nof the most creative mathematicians of the ancient world.\n\n
            <p>Many of the theorems\nin Euclid\'s <i>Elements</i> were first proved by Eudoxus.\nWhile Pythagoras had
                been horrified by the discovery of irrational\nnumbers, Eudoxus is famous for incorporating them into
                arithmetic.\nHe also developed the earliest techniques of the infinitesimal calculus;\nArchimedes
                credits Eudoxus with inventing a principle eventually called\nthe <i>Axiom of Archimedes</i>:\nit avoids
                Zeno\'s paradoxes by, in effect, forbidding\ninfinities and infinitesimals.\nEudoxus\' work with
                irrational numbers, infinitesimals and limits\neventually inspired masters like Dedekind.\nEudoxus also
                introduced an <i>Axiom of Continuity</i>;\nhe was a pioneer in solid geometry;\nand he developed his own
                solution to the Delian cube-doubling problem.\nEudoxus was the first great mathematical astronomer;\nhe
                developed the complicated ancient theory of planetary orbits;\nand may have invented the astrolabe.\nHe
                may have invented the 365.25-day calendar based on leap\nyears, though it remained for Julius Caesar to
                popularize it.\n(It is sometimes said that he knew that\nthe Earth rotates around the Sun, but that
                appears to be false;\nit is instead Aristarchus of Samos, as cited by Archimedes, who\nmay be the first
                "heliocentrist.")\nOne of Eudoxus\' students was Menaechmus, who was first to\ndescribe the conic
                sections and used them to devise a non-Platonic\nsolution to the cube-doubling problem (and perhaps
                the\ncircle-squaring problem as well).\n\n
            <p>Four of Eudoxus\' most famous discoveries were the volume\nof a cone, extension of arithmetic to the
                irrationals, summing\nformula for geometric series, and\nviewing <b><i>&pi;</i></b> as the limit of
                polygonal perimeters.\nNone of these seems difficult today, but it does seem remarkable\nthat they were
                all first achieved by the same man.\nEudoxus has been quoted as saying\n"Willingly would I burn to death
                like Phaeton, were this\nthe price for reaching the sun and learning its shape,\nits size and its
                substance."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Aristotle was the most prominent scientist of the\nancient world, and perhaps the most
                    influential philosopher\nand logician ever;\nhe ranks #13 on Michael Hart\'s list of the Most
                    Influential Persons in History.\nHis science was a standard curriculum for almost 2000
                    years.\nAlthough the physical sciences couldn\'t advance until the\ndiscoveries by great men like
                    Newton and Lavoisier,\nAristotle\'s work in the biological sciences\nwas superb, and served as
                    paradigm until modern times.\nAristotle was personal tutor to the young Alexander the
                    Great.\nAristotle\'s disciple and successor Theophrastus was also a\ngreat scientist, as was
                    Theophrastus\' successor Strato.\n
            <p>Although Aristotle was probably the greatest biologist of the ancient world,\nhis work in physics and
                mathematics may not seem enough\nto qualify for this list.\nBut his teachings covered a very wide gamut
                and dominated\nthe development of ancient science.\nHis writings on definitions, axioms and proofs may
                have influenced Euclid;\nand he was one of the first mathematicians to write on the subject of
                infinity.\nHis writings include geometric theorems, some with proofs\ndifferent from Euclid\'s or
                missing from Euclid altogether; one of these\n(which is seen only in Aristotle\'s work prior to
                Apollonius)\nis that a circle is the locus of points whose distances\nfrom two given points are in
                constant ratio.\n
            <p>A charge sometimes made against Aristotle is that his wrong\nideas held back the development of
                science.\nBut this charge is unfair; Aristotle himself stressed the importance\nof observation and
                experimentation, and to be ready to reject\nold hypotheses and prepare new ones.\nAnd even if, as is
                widely agreed, Aristotle\'s geometric theorems\nwere not his own work, his status as the most
                influential\nlogician and philosopher in all of history\nmakes him a strong candidate for the

                    Alexandria. Little else is known for certain about his life,\nbut several very important
                    mathematical achievements are credited to him.\nHe was the first to prove that there are
                    infinitely\nmany prime numbers; he produced an incomplete proof of\nthe Unique Factorization Theorem
                    (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic);\nand he devised <i>Euclid\'s algorithm</i> for computing
                    gcd.\nHe introduced the Mersenne primes\nand observed that <b>(M<sup>2</sup>+M)/2</b>\nis always
                    perfect (in the sense of Pythagoras) if <b>M</b> is Mersenne.\n(The converse, that any even perfect
                    number has such a corresponding\nMersenne prime, was tackled by Alhazen and proven by Euler.)\nHis
                    books contain many famous theorems, though much of the <i>Elements</i>\nwas due to predecessors like
                    Pythagoras (most of Books I and II),\nHippocrates (Book III), Theodorus, Eudoxus (Book V),\nArchytas
                    (perhaps Book VIII) and Theaetetus.\nBook I starts with an elegant proof that rigid-compass
                    constructions\ncan be implemented with a collapsing compass.\n(Given A, B, C, find CF = AB by
                    first\nconstructing equilateral triangle ACD;\nthen use the compass to find E on AD with AE =
                    AB;\nand finally find F on DC with DF = DE.)\nAlthough notions of trigonometry were not in use,
                    Euclid\'s theorems\ninclude some closely related to the Laws of Sines and Cosines.\nAmong several
                    books attributed to Euclid are\n<i>The Division of the\nScale</i> (a mathematical discussion of
                    music), <i>The Optics</i>,\n<i>The Cartoptrics</i> (a treatise on the theory of mirrors),\na book on
                    spherical geometry, a book on logic fallacies,\nand his comprehensive math textbook <i>The
                        Elements</i>.\nSeveral of his masterpieces have been lost, including\nworks on conic sections
                    and other advanced geometric topics.\nApparently Desargues\' Homology Theorem (a pair of
                    triangles\nis coaxial if and only if it is copolar) was proved in one\nof these lost works; this is
                    the fundamental theorem\nwhich initiated the study of projective geometry.\nEuclid ranks #14 on
                    Michael Hart\'s famous list of\nthe Most Influential Persons in History.\n\n<i>The Elements</i>
                    introduced the notions of axiom and theorem;\nwas used as a textbook for 2000 years; and in fact is
                    still the basis\nfor high school geometry, making\nEuclid the leading mathematics teacher of all
                    time.\nSome think his best inspiration was recognizing that the\nParallel Postulate must be an axiom
                    rather than a theorem.\n\n
            <p>There are many famous quotations about Euclid and his books.\nAbraham Lincoln abandoned his law studies
                when he didn\'t\nknow what "demonstrate" meant and "went home to my father\'s house\n[to read Euclid],
                and stayed there till I could give any proposition\nin the six books of Euclid at sight.\nI then found

                    studied at Euclid\'s school (probably after\nEuclid\'s death), but his work far surpassed, and even
                    leapfrogged,\nthe works of Euclid.\n(For example, some of Euclid\'s more difficult theorems are
                    easy\nanalytic consequences of Archimedes\' Lemma of Centroids.)\nHis achievements are particularly
                    impressive given the\nlack of good mathematical notation in his day.\nHis proofs are noted not only
                    for brilliance but for\nunequaled clarity, with a modern biographer (Heath) describing\nArchimedes\'
                    treatises as "without exception monuments of mathematical\nexposition ... so impressive in their
                    perfection as to create a\nfeeling akin to awe in the mind of the reader."\nArchimedes made advances
                    in number theory, algebra, and analysis,\nbut is most renowned for his many theorems\nof plane and
                    solid geometry.\nHe might have been first to prove Heron\'s formula for\nthe area of a
                    triangle.\nHis excellent approximation to <b>&radic;3</b> indicates that\nhe\'d partially
                    anticipated the method of continued fractions.\nHe developed a recursive method of representing
                    large\nintegers, and was first to note the law of
                    exponents,\n<b>10<sup>a</sup>&middot;10<sup>b</sup> = 10<sup>a+b</sup></b>.\nWorking with exponents,
                    he developed simple notation and names\nfor numbers larger than 10^(10^16); this will seem more
                    startling\nwhen you recall that it was another 18 centuries before Europeans\nwould invent the word
                    "million."\n
            <p>Archimedes found a method to trisect an arbitrary angle (using\na <i>markable</i> straightedge &mdash;
                the construction is impossible\nusing strictly Platonic rules).\nOne of his most remarkable and famous
                geometric results\nwas determining the area of a parabolic section, for which\nhe offered two
                independent proofs, one\nusing his <i>Principle of the Lever</i>,\nthe other using a geometric
                series.\nSome of Archimedes\' work survives only because Thabit ibn Qurra\ntranslated the otherwise-lost
                <i>Book of Lemmas</i>; it contains\nthe angle-trisection method and several ingenious theorems\nabout
                inscribed circles.\n(Thabit shows how to construct a regular heptagon; it may not be\nclear whether this
                came from Archimedes, or was fashioned by Thabit\nby studying Archimedes\' angle-trisection
                method.)\nOther discoveries known only second-hand include\nthe <i>Archimedean semiregular solids</i>
                reported by Pappus,\nand the Broken-Chord Theorem reported by Alberuni.\n\n
            <p>Archimedes and Newton might be the two best geometers ever, but\nalthough each produced ingenious
                geometric proofs, often they used\nnon-rigorous calculus to <i>discover</i> results, and then
                devised\nrigorous geometric proofs for publication.\nHe used integral calculus\nto determine the centers
                of mass of hemisphere and cylindrical\nwedge, and the volume of two cylinders\' intersection.\nHe also
                worked with various spirals, paraboloids of revolution, etc.\nAlthough Archimedes didn\'t develop
                differentiation (integration\'s inverse),\nMichel Chasles credits him (along with Kepler, Cavalieri, and
                Fermat,\nwho all lived more than 18 centuries later)\nas one of the four who developed calculus before
                Newton and Leibniz.\n(Although familiar with the utility of infinitesimals, he\naccepted the "Theorem of
                Eudoxus" which bans them to avoid\nZeno\'s paradoxes. Modern mathematicians refer to that "Theorem"
                as\nthe Axiom of Archimedes.)\n\n

                rotated around the Sun).\nHe was one of the greatest mechanists ever, discovering\nArchimedes\'
                Principle of Hydrostatics (a body partially or completely\nimmersed in a fluid effectively loses weight
                equal to the\nweight of the fluid it displaces).\nHe developed the mathematical foundations underlying
                the\nadvantage of basic machines: lever, screw and compound pulley.\nAlthough the screw was perhaps
                invented by Archytas,\nand Stone-Age man (and even other animals) used the lever,\nit is said that the
                compound\npulley was invented by Archimedes himself.\nFor these achievements he is often ranked ahead of
                Maxwell\nto be called one of the three greatest physicists ever.\nArchimedes was a prolific
                inventor:\nin addition to inventing the compound pulley, he\ninvented the hydraulic screw-pump (called
                Archimedes\' screw);\na miniature planetarium; and several\nwar machines -- catapult, parabolic mirrors
                to burn enemy ships,\na steam cannon, and \'the Claw of Archimedes.\'\nSome scholars attribute the <i>Antikythera
                    mechanism</i>\nto Archimedes. (Is it the Archimedean planetarium mentioned by Cicero?)\n
            <p>His books include\n<i>Floating Bodies</i>,\n<i>Spirals</i>,\n<i>The Sand Reckoner</i>,\n<i>Measurement of
                the Circle</i>,\n<i>Sphere and Cylinder</i>, \n<i>Plane Equilibriums</i>,\n<i>Conoids and Spheroids</i>,\n<i>Quadrature
                of Parabola</i>,\n<i>The Book of Lemmas</i> (translated and attributed by Thabit ibn Qurra),\nvarious
                now-lost works (on Mirrors, Balances and Levers, Semi-regular Polyhedra,\netc.) cited by Pappus or
                others,\nand (discovered only recently,\nand often called his most important work) <i>The Method</i>.\nHe
                developed the <i>Stomachion</i> puzzle (and solved a difficult\nenumeration problem involving it); other
                famous gems\ninclude <i>The Cattle-Problem</i>.\n<i>The Book of Lemmas</i> contains various geometric
                gems\n("the Salinon," "the Shoemaker\'s Knife", etc.) and is credited\nto Archimedes by Thabit ibn Qurra
                but the attribution is disputed.\n\n
            <p>Archimedes discovered formulae for the volume and surface area\nof a sphere, and may even have been first
                to notice and prove the\nsimple relationship between a circle\'s circumference and area.\nFor these
                reasons,\n<b>&pi;</b> is often called <i>Archimedes\' constant</i>.\nHis approximation <b>223/71 < &pi;
                    < 22/7</b>\nwas the best of his day.\n(Apollonius soon surpassed it, but by using Archimedes\'
                method.)\nArchimedes\' Equiarea Map Theorem asserts that a sphere and its enclosing\ncylinder have equal
                surface area (as do the figures\' truncations).\nArchimedes also proved that the volume of that sphere
                is two-thirds the volume\nof the cylinder.\nHe requested that a representation of such a sphere
                and\ncylinder be inscribed on his tomb.\n\n
            <p>That Archimedes shared the attitude of later mathematicians like\nHardy and Brouwer is suggested by
                Plutarch\'s comment that Archimedes regarded\napplied mathematics "as ignoble and sordid ... and did not
                deign\nto [write about his mechanical inventions; instead]\nhe placed his whole ambition in those
                speculations the beauty and subtlety of\nwhich are untainted by any admixture of the common needs of
                life."\n\n
            <p>Some of Archimedes\' greatest writings (including\n<i>The Method</i> and <i>Floating Bodies</i>) are
                preserved only on a\npalimpsest rediscovered in 1906 and mostly deciphered only after 1998.\nIdeas
                unique to that work are an anticipation of Riemann\nintegration, calculating\nthe volume of a
                cylindrical wedge (previously first attributed to Kepler);\nalong with Oresme and Galileo he was among
                the few to comment\non the "equinumerosity paradox" (the fact that are as many perfect\nsquares as
                integers).\nAlthough Euler and Newton\nmay have been the most important mathematicians,\nand Gauss,
                Weierstrass and Riemann the greatest theorem provers,\nit is widely accepted that\nArchimedes was the
                greatest genius who ever lived.\nYet, Hart omits him altogether from his list of Most Influential
                Persons:\nArchimedes was simply <i>too</i> far ahead of his time to have great
                historical\nsignificance.\n(Some think the Scientific Revolution would have begun sooner\nhad <i>The
                    Method</i> been discovered four or five centuries earlier.\nYou <a

                <blockquote>\nApollonius Pergaeus, called "The Great Geometer,"\nis sometimes considered the second
                    greatest\nof ancient Greek mathematicians. (Euclid, Eudoxus and Archytas\nare other candidates for
                    this honor.)\nHis writings on conic sections have been studied until\nmodern times;\nhe developed
                    methods for normals and curvature.\n(He is often credited with inventing the names for
                    parabola,\nhyperbola and ellipse; but these shapes were previously described\nby Menaechmus, and
                    their names may also predate Apollonius.)\nAlthough astronomers eventually concluded it was not
                    physically correct,\nApollonius developed the "epicycle and deferent" model of planetary
                    orbits,\nand proved important theorems in this area.\nHe deliberately emphasized the beauty of pure,
                    rather than\napplied, mathematics, saying his theorems were\n"worthy of acceptance for the sake of
                    the demonstrations themselves."\nThe following\ngeneralization of the Pythagorean Theorem, where M
                    is the midpoint of BC,\nis called Apollonius\' Theorem:\n&nbsp; &nbsp;\n<b>AB<sup> 2</sup> + AC<sup>
                        2</sup> =\n2(AM<sup> 2</sup> + BM<sup> 2</sup>)</b>.\n\n
            <p>Many of his works have survived only in a fragmentary form,\nand the proofs were completely lost.\nMost
                famous was the <i>Problem of Apollonius</i>,\nwhich is to find a circle tangent to three objects, with
                the \nobjects being points, lines, or circles, in any combination.\nConstructing the eight circles each
                tangent to three other circles\nis especially challenging, but just finding the two circles\ncontaining
                two given points and tangent to a given line is\na serious challenge.\nVieta was renowned for
                discovering methods for all ten\ncases of this Problem.\nOther great mathematicians who have enjoyed

            <p>In evaluating the genius of the ancient Greeks,\nit is well to remember that their achievements were
                made\nwithout the convenience of modern notation.\nIt is clear from his writing that Apollonius almost
                developed\nthe analytic geometry of Descartes, but\nfailed due to the lack of such elementary concepts
                as negative numbers.\nLeibniz wrote "He who understands Archimedes and Apollonius will admire less\nthe

                    and\nthe Islamic Empire, and thus, indirectly, Europe.\nAlthough there were great Chinese
                    mathematicians a thousand years before\nthe Han Dynasty (as evidenced by the ancient <i>Zhoubi
                        Suanjing</i>),\nand innovations continued for centuries after Han,\nthe textbook <i>Nine

                    Chinese as <i>Jiu Zhang Suan Shu</i>\nor <i>Chiu Chang Suan Shu</i>)\nwas apparently written during
                    the early Han Dynasty (about 165 BC)\nby Chang Tshang (also spelled Zhang Cang).\n\n
            <p>Many of the mathematical concepts of the early Greeks were\ndiscovered independently in early
                China.\nChang\'s book gives methods of arithmetic (including cube roots)\nand algebra,\nuses the decimal
                system (though zero was represented as just a space,\nrather than a discrete symbol),\nproves the
                Pythagorean Theorem,\nand includes a clever geometric proof that the perimeter of\na right triangle
                times the radius of its inscribing\ncircle equals the area of its circumscribing rectangle.\n(Some of
                this may have been added after the time of Chang;\nsome additions attributed to Liu Hui are mentioned in
                his mini-bio;\nother famous contributors are Jing Fang and Zhang Heng.)\n\n
            <p><i>Nine Chapters</i> was probably based on earlier books,\nlost during the great book burning of 212 BC,
                and\nChang himself may have been a lord who commissioned others to\nprepare the book.\nMoreover,
                important revisions and commentaries were added\nafter Chang, notably by Liu Hui (ca 220-280).\nAlthough
                Liu Hui mentions Chang\'s skill, it isn\'t clear\nChang had the mathematical genius to qualify for this
                list,\nbut he would still be a strong candidate due to his book\'s\nimmense historical importance:\nIt
                was the dominant Chinese mathematical text for centuries,\nand had great influence throughout the Far
                East.\nAfter Chang,\nChinese mathematics continued to flourish, discovering\ntrigonometry, matrix
                methods, the Binomial Theorem, etc.\nSome of the teachings made their way to India,\nand from there to
                the Islamic world and Europe.\nThere is some evidence that the Hindus borrowed the\ndecimal system
                itself from books like <i>Nine Chapters</i>.\n\n
            <p>No one person can be credited with the invention of\nthe decimal system, but key roles were played by
                early Chinese\n(Chang Tshang and Liu Hui),\nBrahmagupta (and earlier Hindus including Aryabhata),\nand
                Leonardo Fibonacci.\n(After Fibonacci, Europe still did not embrace the decimal system\nuntil the works

                <blockquote>Ptolemy may be the most famous astronomer\nbefore Copernicus, but he borrowed heavily from

                    three greatest astronomers ever.\nCareful study of the <i>errors</i> in the catalogs\nof Ptolemy and
                    Hipparchus reveal both that Ptolemy\nborrowed his data from Hipparchus, and that Hipparchus\nused
                    principles of spherical trig to simplify his work.\nClassical Hindu astronomers, including the
                    6th-century genius\nAryabhata, borrow much from Ptolemy and Hipparchus.\n
            <p>Hipparchus is called the "Father of Trigonometry"; he\ndeveloped spherical trigonometry,\nproduced trig
                tables, and more.\nHe produced at least fourteen texts of physics and mathematics\nnearly all of which
                have been lost, but which seem to\nhave had great teachings, including\nmuch of Newton\'s Laws of
                Motion.\nIn one obscure surviving work he demonstrates familiarity\nwith the combinatorial enumeration
                method now called Schr&ouml;der\'s Numbers.\nHe invented the circle-conformal stereographic\nand
                orthographic map projections which carry his name.\nAs an astronomer, Hipparchus is credited with the
                discovery\nof equinox precession, length of the year, thorough\nstar catalogs, and invention\nof the
                armillary sphere and perhaps the astrolabe.\nHe had great historical influence in Europe, India
                and\nPersia, at least if credited also with Ptolemy\'s influence.\n(Hipparchus himself was influenced by
                Babylonian astronomers.)\nHipparchus\' work implies a better approximation to <b>&pi;</b>\nthan that of
                Apollonius, perhaps it was <b>&pi; &asymp; 377/120</b> as\nPtolemy used.\n\n
            <p>The <i>Antikythera mechanism</i> is an astronomical clock\nconsidered amazing for its time.\nIt may have
                been built about the time of Hipparchus\'\ndeath, but lost after a few decades\n(remaining at the bottom
                of the sea for 2000 years).\nThe mechanism implemented the complex orbits which Hipparchus had
                developed\nto explain irregular planetary motions;\nit\'s not unlikely the great genius helped design
                this intricate\nanalog computer, which may have been built in Rhodes\nwhere Hipparchus spent his final
                decades.\n(Recent studies suggest that the mechanism was designed\nin Archimedes\' time, and that
                therefore that genius\nmight have been the designer.)\n\n

                    famous for his invention of the aeolipile which\nrotated using\nsteam from an attached cauldron, and
                    is considered the first steam engine.\n(Vitruvius may have described such a machine before
                    Heron.)\nHe is noted for designing various toys (probably developed as teaching\naids for his
                    lectures); these included a puppet theater driven by strings\nand weights, a robot trumpet, trick
                    wine glasses, a windmill-driven organ,\nand coin-operated vending machine.\nHis most famous

                    Earth was the center of the universe,\nbut this made it very difficult to explain the orbits of the
                    other planets.\nThis problem had been considered by Eudoxus, Apollonius, and Hipparchus,\nwho
                    developed a very complicated geocentric model involving\nconcentric spheres and epicycles.\nPtolemy
                    perfected (or, rather, complicated) this model even further,\nintroducing \'equants\' to further
                    fine-tune the orbital speeds;\nthis model was the standard for 14 centuries.\nWhile some Greeks,
                    notably Aristarchus and Seleucus,\nproposed heliocentric models,\nthese were rejected because there
                    was no parallax among stars.\n(Aristarchus guessed that the stars were at an almost
                    unimaginable\ndistance, explaining the lack of parallax.\nAristarchus would be almost unknown except
                    that\nArchimedes mentions, and assumes, Aristarchus\' heliocentrism in\n<i>The Sand Reckoner</i>.\nI
                    suspect that Archimedes accepted heliocentrism, but thought saying\nso openly would distract from
                    his work.\nSeveral thinkers proposed a hybrid system with Mercury and Venus rotating\nthe Sun but
                    the outer planets and the Sun itself rotating Earth; these\nthinkers may have included ancient
                    Egyptians, the Greek Heraclides of Pontus,\nsome of the Islamic scientists,\na member of Madhava\'s
                    Kerala school, and Tycho Brahe -- the astronomer\nwho linked Copernicus to Kepler.\n
            <p>A related question is: Does the Earth spin daily on its axis? All\nheliocentrists, beginning with
                Heraclides of Pontus, seem to have accepted\nthat, as well as some who were more doubtful\nabout the
                Earth\'s annual orbit.\nAnd another related question is: Is the universe finite, or is it
                infinite?\nDemocritus, Seleucus, Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno\nwere three who proposed an
                infinite universe prior to Galileo.\n
            <p>Hipparchus was another ancient Greek who considered heliocentrism but,\nbecause he never guessed\nthat
                orbits were ellipses rather than cascaded circles, was unable to come\nup with a heliocentric model that
                fit his data.)\nAryabhata, Alhazen, Alberuni, Omar Khayy&aacute;m, (perhaps some other\nIslamic
                mathematicians like al-Tusi), Regiomontanus, and Leonardo\nda Vinci are\nother great pre-Copernican
                mathematicians who may have accepted\nthe possibility of heliocentrism. \nAnother reason to doubt that
                the Earth moves, is that we don\'t\nfeel that motion, or see its effect on falling bodies.
                This\ndifficulty, which almost disappears once Newton\'s First Law of Motion\nis accepted, was addressed
                before Newton by Jean Buridan,\nNicole Oresme, Giordano Bruno,\nPierre Gassendi (1592-1655) and, of
                course, Galileo Galilei.\n
            <p>The great skill demonstrated by Ptolemy and his predecessors in\ndeveloping their complex geocentric
                cosmology\nmay have <i>set back</i> science since in fact\nthe Earth rotates around the Sun.\nThe
                geocentric models couldn\'t\nexplain the observed changes in the brightness of Mars or Venus,\nbut it
                was the phases of Venus, discovered by Galileo after the invention\nof the telescope, that finally led
                to general acceptance of heliocentrism. \n(Ptolemy\'s model predicted phases, but timed quite
                differently from\nGalileo\'s observations.)\n\n
            <p>Since the planets move without friction, their motions offer a pure\nview of the Laws of Motion; this is
                one reason that the heliocentric\nbreakthroughs of Copernicus, Kepler and Newton triggered the
                advances\nin mathematical physics which led to the Scientific Revolution.\n<b>Heliocentrism offered an
                    even more key understanding</b> that lead to\nmassive change in scientific thought.\nFor Ptolemy and
                other geocentrists, the "fixed" stars\nwere just lights on a sphere <i>rotating around the earth</i>,
                but after\nthe Copernican Revolution the fixed stars were understood to be\nimmensely far away; this
                made it possible to imagine that they were\nthemselves suns, perhaps with planets of their own. (Nicole
                Oresme\nand Nicholas of Cusa were pre-Copernican thinkers who wrote on both\nthe geocentric question and
                the possibility of other worlds.)\nThe Copernican perspective led\nGiordano Bruno and Galileo to posit a
                single common set of \nphysical laws which ruled both on Earth and in the Heavens.\n(It was this, rather
                than just the happenstance of planetary orbits,\nthat eventually most outraged the Roman Church....\nAnd
                we\'re getting ahead of our story:\nCopernicus, Bruno, Galileo and Kepler lived 14 centuries after
                Ptolemy.)\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    preserved the ancient\nChinese learnings.)\nAmong Liu\'s achievements\nare an emphasis on
                    generalizations and proofs,\nincorporation of negative numbers into arithmetic,\nan early
                    recognition of the notions of infinitesimals and limits,\nthe Gaussian elimination method of

                    Cavalieri\'s Principle),\nanticipation of Horner\'s Method,\nand a new method to calculate square
                    roots.\nLike Archimedes, Liu discovered the formula for a circle\'s area;\nhowever he failed to
                    calculate a sphere\'s volume, writing\n"Let us leave this problem to whoever can tell the

                    books on\narithmetic and algebra,\nand explored number theory further than anyone earlier.\nHe
                    advanced a rudimentary arithmetic and algebraic notation, allowed\nrational-number solutions to his
                    problems rather than just integers,\nand was aware of results like the Brahmagupta-Fibonacci
                    Identity;\nfor these reasons he is often called the "Father of Algebra."\nHis work, however, may
                    seem quite limited to a modern eye:\nhis methods were not generalized, he knew nothing\nof negative
                    numbers, and, though he often dealt with quadratic\nequations, never seems to have commented on
                    their second solution.\nHis notation, clumsy as it was, was used for many centuries.\n(The shorthand
                    <b>x<sup>3</sup></b>\nfor "x cubed" was not invented until Descartes.)\n\n
            <p>Very little is known about Diophantus (he might even have come from\nBabylonia, whose algebraic ideas he
                borrowed).\nMany of his works have been lost, including proofs for lemmas\ncited in the surviving work,
                some of which are so\ndifficult it would almost stagger the imagination to\nbelieve Diophantus really
                had proofs.\nAmong these are Fermat\'s conjecture (Lagrange\'s theorem)\nthat every integer is the sum
                of four squares, and the\nfollowing:\n"Given any positive rationals <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> with <b>a>b</b>,\nthere
                exist positive rationals <b>c</b>, <b>d</b> such that\n<b>a<sup>3</sup>-b<sup>3</sup> =
                    c<sup>3</sup>+d<sup>3</sup></b>."\n(This latter "lemma" was investigated by Vieta and Fermat
                and\nfinally solved, with some difficulty, in the 19th century.\nIt seems unlikely that Diophantus
                actually had proofs for such "lemmas.")\n</blockquote>\n\n

                minimizes material for an equal-area\npartitioning was finally proved in 1999 by Thomas Hales, who
                also\nproved the related Kepler Conjecture.)\nPappus stated, but did not fully solve, the <i>Problem of

                    inventions [but] it escaped the\ngenius of Archimedes and Apollonius."\nBut even after Fibonacci
                    introduced the system to Europe, it was another\n400 years before it came into common use.\n
            <p>Ancient Greeks, by the way, did not use the\nunwieldy Roman numerals, but rather used 27 symbols,
                denoting\n1 to 9, 10 to 90, and 100 to 900.\nUnlike our system, with ten digits separate from the
                alphabet,\nthe 27 Greek number symbols were the <i>same</i> as their\nalphabet\'s letters; this might
                have hindered\nthe development of "syncopated" notation.\nThe most ancient Hindu records did not use
                the\nten digits of Aryabhata, but rather a system\nsimilar to that of the ancient Greeks, suggesting
                that\nChina, and not India, may indeed be the "ultimate" source of the modern\ndecimal system.\n
            <p>The Chinese used a form of decimal abacus as early as 3000 BC;\nif it doesn\'t qualify, by itself, as a
                "decimal system" then\npictorial depictions of its numbers would.\nYet for thousands of years after its
                abacus, China had no zero symbol\nother than plain space; and apparently didn\'t have one until
                after\nthe Hindus. Ancient Persians and Mayans <i>did</i> have place-value\nnotation <i>with</i> zero
                symbols, but neither qualify as inventing\na base-10 decimal system: Persia used the base-60 Babylonian
                system;\nMayans used base-20. \n(Another difference is that the Hindus had nine distinct digit
                symbols\nto go with their zero, while earlier place-value systems\nbuilt up from just two symbols: 1 and
                either 5 or 10.)\nThe Old Kingdom Egyptians did use a base-ten system, but it was\nsimilar to that of
                Greece and Vedic India:\n1, 10, 100 were depicted as separate symbols.\n
            <p>Conclusion: The decimal place-value system with zero symbol seems\nto be an obvious invention that in
                fact was very hard to invent.\nIf you insist on a single winner then India might be it.\nBut China,

                <blockquote>Leonardo (known today as Fibonacci)\nintroduced the decimal system and other new methods of
                    arithmetic to Europe,\nand relayed the mathematics of the Hindus, Persians, and Arabs.\nOthers,
                    especially Gherard of Cremona, had translated Islamic\nmathematics, e.g. the works of al-Khow&acirc;rizmi,
                    into Latin,\nbut Leonardo was the influential teacher.\n(Two centuries earlier, the
                    mathematician-Pope, Gerbert of Aurillac,\nhad tried unsuccessfully to introduce the decimal system
                    to Europe.)\nLeonardo also re-introduced older Greek ideas like\nMersenne numbers and Diophantine
                    equations.\nHis writings cover a very broad range including\nnew theorems of geometry,\nmethods to
                    construct and convert Egyptian fractions\n(which were still in wide use),\nirrational numbers,\nthe
                    Chinese Remainder Theorem,\ntheorems about Pythagorean triplets,\nand the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
                    13, ....\nwhich is now linked with the name Fibonacci.\nIn addition to his great historic importance
                    and fame\n(he was a favorite of Emperor Frederick II),\nLeonardo `Fibonacci\' is called "the
                    greatest number theorist\nbetween Diophantus and Fermat" and "the most <i>talented</i>\nmathematician
                    of the Middle Ages."\n\n
            <p>Leonardo is most famous for his book <i>Liber Abaci</i>, but\nhis <i>Liber Quadratorum</i> provides the
                best demonstration of his skill.\nHe defined <i>congruums</i> and proved theorems about them,\nincluding
                a theorem establishing the conditions for three square numbers\nto be in consecutive arithmetic series;
                this has been called\nthe finest work in number theory prior to Fermat\n(although a similar statement
                was made about one of Bhaskara II\'s theorems).\nAlthough often overlooked, this work includes a
                proof\nof the <i>n = 4</i> case of Fermat\'s Last Theorem.\n(Leonardo\'s proof of FLT4 is widely ignored
                or considered incomplete.\n<a href="fibflt4.htm">I\'m preparing a page to consider that question.</a>\nAl-Farisi
                was another ancient mathematician who noted FLT4, although\nattempting no proof.)\nAnother of
                Leonardo\'s noteworthy achievements was proving that\nthe roots of a certain cubic equation could not
                have any of the\nconstructible forms Euclid had outlined in Book 10 of his <i>Elements</i>.\nHe also
                wrote on, but didn\'t prove, Wilson\'s Theorem.\n\n
            <p>Leonardo provided Europe with the decimal system,\nalgebra and the \'lattice\' method of multiplication,
                all\nfar superior to the methods then in use.\nHe introduced notation like <b>3/5</b>; his clever
                extension\nof this for quantities like <i>5 yards, 2 feet, and 3 inches</i>\nis more efficient than
                today\'s notation.\nIt seems hard to believe but before the decimal\nsystem, mathematicians had no
                notation for zero.\nReferring to this system,\nGauss was later to exclaim "To what heights would
                science\nnow be raised if Archimedes had made that discovery!"\n\n
            <p>Some histories describe him as bringing Islamic mathematics\nto Europe, but in Fibonacci\'s own preface
                to <i>Liber Abaci</i>,\nhe specifically credits the Hindus:\n
            <blockquote>\n... as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art,\nto the nine digits of the Hindus,
                the knowledge of the art\nvery much appealed to me before all others, and for it I\nrealized that all
                its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria,\nGreece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying
                methods;\n<br>\n... But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art\nof Pythagoras, I considered
                as almost a mistake in respect\nto the method of the Hindus. Therefore,\nembracing more stringently that
                method of the Hindus, and\ntaking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain\nthings from my own
                understanding and inserting also certain\nthings from the niceties of Euclid\'s geometric art, I
                have\nstriven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably\nas I could, ...\n
            </blockquote>
            \n\n<p>Had the Scientific Renaissance begun in the Islamic Empire,\nsomeone like al-Khow&acirc;rizmi would
                have greater historic\nsignificance than Fibonacci,\nbut the Renaissance did happen in Europe.\n<i>Liber
                    Abaci</i>\'s summary of the\ndecimal system has been called "the most important sentence\never
                written."\nEven granting this to be an exaggeration, there is no doubt\nthat the Scientific Revolution
                owes a huge debt to\nLeonardo `Fibonacci\' Pisano.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    personal chaplain to King Charles V.\n(One of his early teachers was Jean Buridan (ca 1300-ca 1358),
                    famous\nfor positing what became Newton\'s First Law of Motion, contrary to\nAristotelian
                    dogma.)\nThe King commissioned him to translate the works of\nAristotle into French (with Oresme
                    thus playing key roles in\nthe development of both French science and French language),
                    and\nrewarded him by making him a Bishop.\nHe wrote several books; was a renowned philosopher and
                    natural scientist\n(challenging several of Aristotle\'s ideas);\ncontributed to economics (e.g.
                    anticipating Gresham\'s Law)\nand to optics (he was first to posit curved refraction).\nAlthough the
                    Earth\'s annual orbit around the Sun was left to Copernicus,\nOresme was among the pre-Copernican
                    thinkers to claim clearly that the\nEarth spun daily on its axis.\n\n

                it is said this was the\nfirst abstract graph.\n(Some believe that this effort inspired\nDescartes\'
                coordinate geometry and Galileo.)\nOresme was aware of Gersonides\' work on harmonic numbers and was
                among\nthose who attempted to link music theory to the ratios of celestial\norbits, writing "the heavens
                are like a man who sings a melody and\nat the same time dances, thus making music ... in song and in

                the transfer \nof mass from soil to growing plant.\nNicholas was also a mathematician: he wrote on
                geometric problems,\ncalendar reform,\nand invented the <i>Borda Count</i> method of balloting
                (although\nit is named after its 18th-century rediscoverer),\nbut his work doesn\'t qualify him for our
                list.\nHe belongs in our story because he deduced that the Earth\norbited the Sun before Copernicus did,
                and made a deduction that Copernicus\nmissed: that the universe is immensely huge or infinite; and the
                fixed stars\nmay have their own planets with their own life forms.\nHe was far ahead of his time, but
                his writings eventually influenced\nGalileo, Leibniz, and another mathematician-priest more famous than
                himself:\nGiordano Bruno, who wrote\n"If Nicholas [of Cusa] had not been hindered by his priest\'s
                vestment,\nhe would have even been greater than Pythagoras!"\n

                <blockquote>Leonardo da Vinci is most renowned for his paintings --\n<i>Mona Lisa</i>\nand <i>The Last
                    Supper</i> are among the most discussed\nand admired paintings ever --\nbut he did much other work
                    and was probably the most\ntalented, versatile and prolific polymath ever to live;\nhis writings
                    exceed 13,000 folios.\nHe developed new techniques, and principles of perspective geometry,\nfor
                    drawing, painting and sculpture;\nhe was also an expert architect and engineer;\nand surely the most
                    prolific inventor of all time.\nAlthough most of his paper designs were never built, Leonardo\'s
                    inventions\ninclude reflecting and refracting telescope, adding machine,\nparabolic
                    compass,\nimproved anemometer, parachute, helicopter, flying ornithopter,\nseveral war machines
                    (multi-barreled gun, steam-driven cannon,\ntank, giant crossbow, finned mortar shells, portable
                    bridge),\npumps, an accurate spring-operated clock,\nbobbin winder, robots, scuba gear, an elaborate
                    musical\ninstrument he called the \'viola organista,\' and more.\n(Some of his designs, including
                    the viola organista, his\nparachute, and a large single-span bridge, were finally built
                    five\ncenturies later; and worked as intended.)\nLike another genius (Albert Einstein) da Vinci was
                    intrigued\nby the science of river meanders; there is a meandering river\nin the background of <i>Mona
                        Lisa</i>.\nHis scientific writings are much more extensive and thorough\nthan is generally
                    appreciated; he made advances in anatomy, botany,\nand many other fields of science;\nhe developed
                    much mechanics including the theory of the arch;\nhe developed an octant-based map projection;\nhe
                    was first to conceive of plate tectonics; and,\nin one cryptic reference, shows belief in
                    heliocentrism.\nHe was also a poet and musician.\n
            <p>He had little formal training in mathematics until he was\nin his mid-40\'s, when he and Luca Pacioli
                (the other great Italian\nmathematician of that era) began tutoring each other.\nDespite this slow
                start, he did make novel achievements in mathematics:\nhe was first to note the simple classification of
                symmetry\ngroups on the plane, achieved interesting bisections\nand mensurations, advanced the craft of
                descriptive geometry,\nand developed an approximate solution\nto the circle-squaring problem.\nHe was
                first to discover the 60-vertex shape now called "buckyball."\n(Leonardo is also widely credited with
                the elegant two-hexagon proof\nof the Pythagorean Theorem, but this authorship\nappears to be a
                myth.)\nAlong with Archimedes, Alberuni, Leibniz, and J. W. von Goethe,\nLeonardo da Vinci was among the
                greatest geniuses ever;\nbut none of these appears on Hart\'s List\nof the Most Influential Persons in
                History:\ngenius doesn\'t imply influence.\n(However, M.I.T.\'s Pantheon project, using the statistics
                of\non-line biographies, prepared a list of the Thirty-Five (or Eighty)\nMost Influential Persons in
                History; in addition to five (six) names already\non our list and Hart\'s -- Aristotle, Newton,
                Einstein, Galileo, Euclid (and Descartes) --\ntheir list includes four (seven) other
                mathematicians\nmissing from Hart\'s list: Plato, Leonardo, Pythagoras, Archimedes\n(and Thales, Pascal,
                Ptolemy).\n
            <p>Leonardo was also a writer and philosopher. Among his notable adages are\n"Simplicity is the ultimate
                sophistication,"\nand "The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding,"\nand "Human ingenuity ... will
                never discover any inventions more\nbeautiful, more simple or more practical than those of

                <blockquote>The European Renaissance developed in 15th-century\nItaly, with the blossoming of great art,
                    and\nas scholars read books by great Islamic scientists like Alhazen.\nThe earliest of these great
                    Italian polymaths were largely not noted\nfor mathematics, and Leonardo da Vinci began serious math
                    study\nonly very late in life, so the best candidates for mathematical greatness\nin the Italian
                    Renaissance were foreigners.\nAlong with Regiomontanus from Bavaria, there was an even more
                    famous\nman from Poland.\n
            <p>Nicolaus Copernicus (Mikolaj Kopernik) was a polymath:\nhe studied law and medicine;\npublished poetry;
                contemplated astronomy;\nworked professionally as a church scholar and diplomat;\nand was also a
                painter.\nHe studied Islamic works on astronomy and geometry\nat the University of Bologna, and
                eventually wrote a book of great impact.\nAlthough his only famous theorem of mathematics (that certain
                trochoids are\nstraight lines) may have been derived from Oresme\'s work,\nor copied from Nasir
                al-Tusi,\nit was mathematical thought that led Copernicus to the conclusion\nthat the Earth rotates
                around the Sun.\nDespite opposition from the Roman church, this discovery\nled, via Galileo, Kepler and
                Newton, to the Scientific Revolution.\nFor this revolution, Copernicus is ranked #19 on Hart\'s List\nof
                the Most Influential Persons in History; however I think\nthere are several reasons why Copernicus\'
                importance may be exaggerated:\n(1) Copernicus\' system still used circles and epicycles, so it\nwas
                left to Kepler to discover the facts of elliptical orbits;\n(2) he retained the notion of a sphere of
                fixed stars,\nthus missing the unifying insight that our sun is one of many;\n(3) Giordano Bruno
                (1548-1600), who built on Copernicus\'\ndiscovery, was a better and more influential
                scientist,\nanticipating some of Galileo\'s concepts;\nand (4) the Scientific Revolution didn\'t really
                get underway\nuntil the invention of the telescope, which would have soon\nled to the discovery of
                heliocentrism in any event.\n\n
            <p>Until the Protestant Reformation, which began about the time\nof Copernicus\' discovery, European
                scientists were reluctant to challenge\nthe Catholic Church and its belief in geocentrism.\nCopernicus\'
                book was published only posthumously.\nIt remains controversial whether earlier Islamic or Hindu
                mathematicians\n(or even Archimedes with his <i>The Sand Reckoner</i>)\nbelieved in heliocentrism,
                but\nwere also inhibited by religious orthodoxy.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Girolamo Cardano (or Jerome Cardan) was a highly\nrespected physician and was first to
                    describe typhoid fever.\nHe was also an accomplished gambler and\nchess player and wrote an early
                    book on probability.\nHe was also a remarkable inventor:\nthe combination lock, an advanced gimbal,
                    a\nciphering tool, and the Cardan shaft with universal joints are all\nhis inventions and are in use
                    to this day.\n(The U-joint is sometimes called the Cardan joint.)\nHe also helped develop the camera
                    obscura.\nCardano made contributions to physics: he noted that\nprojectile trajectories are
                    parabolas, and may have been first\nto note the impossibility of perpetual motion machines.\nHe did
                    work in philosophy, geology, hydrodynamics,\nmusic; he wrote books on medicine and\nan encyclopedia
                    of natural science.\n\n
            <p>But Cardano is most remembered for his achievements in mathematics.\nHe was first to publish general
                solutions\nto cubic and quartic equations,\nand first to publish the use of complex numbers in
                calculations.\n(Cardano\'s Italian colleagues deserve much credit:\nFerrari first solved the quartic, he
                or Tartaglia the cubic; and\nBombelli first treated the complex numbers as numbers in their own
                right.\nCardano may have been the <i>last</i> great mathematician\nunwilling to deal with negative
                numbers: his treatment of cubic\nequations had to deal with <i>ax<sup>3</sup> - bx + c = 0</i>\nand <i>ax<sup>3</sup>
                    - bx = c</i> as\ntwo different cases.)\nCardano introduced binomial coefficients and the
                Binomial\nTheorem, and introduced and solved the geometric\nhypocycloid problem, as well as other
                geometric theorems\n(e.g. the theorem underlying the 2:1 spur wheel\nwhich converts circular to
                reciprocal rectilinear motion).\nCardano is credited with <i>Cardano\'s Ring Puzzle</i>,\nstill
                manufactured today and related to the\n<i>Tower of Hanoi</i> puzzle.\n(This puzzle may predate Cardano,
                and may even have been\nknown in ancient China.)\nDa Vinci and Galileo may have been more
                influential\nthan Cardano, but of the three great generalists\nin the century before Kepler, it seems
                clear that Cardano was the\nmost accomplished mathematician.\n\n
            <p>Cardano\'s life had tragic elements.\nThroughout his life he was tormented that his\nfather (a friend of
                Leonardo da Vinci) married\nhis mother only after Cardano was born.\n(And his mother tried several times
                to abort him.)\nCardano\'s reputation for gambling and aggression interfered\nwith his career.\nHe
                practiced astrology and was imprisoned for heresy\nwhen he cast a horoscope for Jesus.\n(This and other
                problems were due in part to\nrevenge by Tartaglia for Cardano\'s\nrevealing his secret algebra
                formulae.)\nHis son apparently murdered his own wife.\nLeibniz wrote of Cardano:\n"Cardano was a great
                man with all his faults;\nwithout them, he would have been incomparable."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Fran&ccedil;ois Vi&egrave;te (or Franciscus Vieta) was a French\nnobleman and lawyer who was
                    a favorite of King Henry IV and eventually\nbecame a royal privy councillor.\nIn one notable
                    accomplishment he broke the Spanish diplomatic code,\nallowing the French government to read
                    Spain\'s messages and\npublish a secret Spanish letter; this apparently led to the end\nof the
                    Huguenot Wars of Religion.\n\n
            <p>More importantly, Vieta was certainly\nthe best French mathematician prior to Descartes and Fermat.\nHe
                laid the groundwork for modern mathematics;\nhis works were the primary teaching for both Descartes and
                Fermat;\nIsaac Newton also studied Vieta.\nIn his role as a young tutor Vieta used decimal numbers
                before they\nwere popularized by Simon Stevin and may have guessed\nthat planetary orbits were ellipses
                before Kepler.\nVieta did work in geometry, reconstructing and publishing proofs\nfor Apollonius\' lost
                theorems, including all ten cases of the\ngeneral <i>Problem of Apollonius</i>.\nVieta also used his new
                algebraic techniques\nto construct a regular heptagon.\nHe discovered several trigonometric identities
                including\na generalization of Ptolemy\'s Formula,\nthe latter (then called <i>prosthaphaeresis</i>)\nproviding
                a calculation shortcut similar to logarithms in that\nmultiplication is reduced to\naddition (or
                exponentiation reduced to multiplication).\nVieta also used trigonometry to find real solutions\nto
                cubic equations for which the Italian methods had\nrequired complex-number arithmetic; he also used
                trigonometry\nto solve a particular 45th-degree equation that had been\nposed as a challenge.\nSuch
                trigonometric formulae revolutionized calculations and may\neven have helped stimulate the development
                and use of\nlogarithms by Napier and Kepler.\nHe developed the first infinite-product formula for <b>&pi;</b>.\nIn
                addition to his geometry and trigonometry, he also\nfound results in number theory, but\nVieta is most
                famous for his systematic use of decimal notation\nand variable letters, for which he is sometimes
                called the "Father of\nModern Algebra."\n(Vieta used A,E,I,O,U for unknowns and consonants for
                parameters;\nit was Descartes who first used X,Y,Z for unknowns and A,B,C for parameters.)\nIn his works
                Vieta emphasized the relationships between algebraic\nexpressions and geometric constructions.\nOne key
                insight he had is that addends must be homogeneous\n(i.e., "apples shouldn\'t be added to oranges"), a
                seemingly trivial idea\nbut which can aid intuition even today.\n\n
            <p>Descartes, who once wrote "I began where Vieta finished," is\nnow extremely famous, while Vieta is much
                less known. (He isn\'t\n<i>even mentioned once</i> in Bell\'s famous <i>Men of Mathematics</i>.)\nMany
                would now agree this is due in large measure to Descartes\'\ndeliberate deprecations of competitors in
                his quest for personal glory.\n(Vieta wasn\'t particularly humble either, calling himself\nthe "French
                Apollonius.")\n

            <p>Vieta\'s formula for <b>&pi;</b> is clumsy to express\nwithout trigonometry, even with modern
                notation.\nEasiest may be to consider it the result of the BASIC program above.\nUsing this formula,
                Vieta constructed an approximation to <b>&pi;</b>\nthat was best-yet by a European, though not as
                accurate as al-Kashi\'s\ntwo centuries earlier.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                burned alive.\nBefore his execution he was tortured for seven years but never recanted,\ninstead saying
                "Maybe you who condemn me are in greater fear than I\nwho am condemned."\n<p>One historian claims that
                    it was Bruno\'s publications in 1584 and their\ninfluence that defined the transition from medieval
                    thought to modern\nscientific thought.\nWilliam Gilbert (who laid the foundations of electricity and
                    magnetism,\nwhich is called the first important scientific discovery by an
                    Englishman),\nacknowledged the influence of Bruno\'s cosmology.\nThe Revolution started by Nicholas
                    and Bruno was a revolt against\nthe Church\'s embracing Aristotle\'s teachings, as Bruno made clear
                    when\nhe wrote "There is no absolute up or down, as Aristotle taught;\nno absolute position in
                    space.... Everywhere there is incessant relative\nchange ... and the observer is always at the
                    centre of things."\nBruno made few mathematical discoveries, if any; but some consider him to
                    be\none of history\'s great geniuses, in a class with Johann von Goethe,\nLeonardo da Vinci, Francis
                    Bacon, Voltaire, Nietzsche, and some of the\nvery greatest mathematicians.\n</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Stevin was one of the greatest practical scientists\nof the Late Middle Ages.\nHe worked
                    with Holland\'s dykes and windmills;\nas a military engineer he developed fortifications and systems
                    of flooding;\nhe invented a carriage with sails that traveled faster than with horses\nand used it
                    to entertain his patron, the Prince of Orange.\nHe discovered several laws of mechanics including
                    those\nfor energy conservation and hydrostatic pressure.\nHe lived slightly before Galileo who is
                    now much more famous,\nbut Stevin discovered the equal rate of falling bodies before Galileo
                    did;\nand his explanation of tides was better than Galileo\'s, though still incomplete.\nHe was
                    first to write on the concept of unstable equilibrium.\nHe invented improved accounting methods, and
                    (though also invented\nat about the same time by Chinese mathematician Zhu Zaiyu\nand anticipated by
                    Galileo\'s father, Vincenzo Galilei)\nthe equal-temperament music scale.\nHe also did work in
                    descriptive geometry,\ntrigonometry, optics, geography, and astronomy.\n
            <p>In mathematics,\nStevin is best known for the notion of real numbers\n(previously integers, rationals and
                irrationals were treated separately;\nnegative numbers and even zero and one were often not considered
                numbers).\nHe introduced (a clumsy form of) decimal fractions to Europe;\nsuggested a decimal
                metric\nsystem, which was finally adopted 200 years later;\ninvented other basic notation like the
                symbol
                <large><b>&radic;</b></large>
                .\nStevin proved several theorems about perspective geometry,\nan important result in mechanics, and
                special cases of\nthe Intermediate Value Theorem later attributed to Bolzano and Cauchy.\nStevin\'s
                books, written in Dutch rather than Latin,\nwere widely read and hugely influential.\nHe was a very key
                figure in the development of modern European mathematics,\nand may belong on our List.\n</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Napier was a Scottish Laird who was a noted theologian\nand thought by many to be a
                    magician\n(his nickname was Marvellous Merchiston).\nToday, however, he is best known\nfor his work
                    with <i>logarithms</i>, a word he invented.\n(Several others, including Archimedes, had anticipated
                    the use of logarithms.)\nHe published the first large table\nof logarithms and also helped
                    popularize usage of the decimal point\nand lattice multiplication.\nHe invented <i>Napier\'s
                        Bones</i>,\na crude hand calculator which could be used for division and\nroot extraction, as
                    well as multiplication.\nHe also had inventions outside mathematics, especially\nseveral different
                    kinds of war machine.\n\n
            <p>Napier\'s noted textbooks also contain an exposition\nof spherical trigonometry.\nAlthough he was
                certainly very clever (and had novel\nmathematical insights not mentioned in this summary),\nNapier
                proved no deep theorem\nand may not belong in the Top 100.\nNevertheless, his revolutionary methods of
                arithmetic had\nimmense historical importance; his logarithm tables were used\nby Johannes Kepler
                himself, and led to the Scientific Revolution.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Galileo discovered the laws of inertia (including rudimentary\nforms of all three of
                    Newton\'s laws of motion), falling bodies (including\nparabolic trajectories), and the pendulum; he
                    also introduced the notion\nof relativity which later physicists found so fruitful.\n(Although he
                    admired Galileo greatly, Einstein\'s famous result\nwas somewhat misnamed: it depended on the <i>absoluteness</i>,\nnot
                    relativity, of the speed of light.)\nGalileo discovered important principles of dynamics, including
                    the\nessential notion that the vector sum of forces produce an\nacceleration.\n(Aristotle seems not
                    to have considered the notion of acceleration,\nthough his successor Strato of Lampsacus did write
                    on it.)\nGalileo may have been first to note that a larger body has less\nrelative cohesive strength
                    than a smaller body.\nHe was a great inventor: in addition to being first to conceive\nof a pendulum
                    clock and of a thermometer, he developed\na new type of pump, the first compound-lens
                    microscope,\nand the best telescope, hydrostatic balance,\nand cannon sector of his day.\nAs a
                    famous astronomer, Galileo\npointed out that Jupiter\'s Moons, which he discovered, provide\na
                    natural clock and allow a universal time to be determined\nby telescope anywhere on Earth.\n(This
                    was of little use in ocean navigation since a ship\'s rocking\nprevents the required delicate
                    observations.\nGalileo tried to measure the speed of light, but it was too fast for\nhim. However 66
                    years after Galileo discovered Jupiter\'s moons\nand proposed using them as a clock,\nthe astronomer
                    Roemer inferred the speed of light from that \'clock\':\nthe clock had a discrepancy of up to seven
                    minutes depending\non the Earth-Jupiter distance.)\nGalileo\'s other astronomical discoveries also
                    included sunspots\nand lunar craters.\n
            <p>Perhaps Galileo\'s most important astronomical discovery was the phases\nof Venus. Ptolemy\'s epicycles,
                Copernicus\' epicycles, and Kepler\'s ellipses\nall gave almost the same solutions for planets\'
                apparent positions,\n<i>but Ptolemy\'s system gave completely wrong predictions about\nthe phases of
                    Venus.</i>\nGalileo\'s discovery of Venus\' phases was the\ncritical fact which finally forced
                acceptance of heliocentrism.\n(It\'s possible that Galileo\'s pursuit of Venus\' phases was inspired in
                part\nby Galileo\'s student, Benedetto Castelli.)\nJust as modern inventors sometimes mail sealed
                envelopes to an\narbiter to establish precedence, Galileo sent an anagram to Kepler,\nto later prove the
                date of his unpublished discovery.\n(The anagram was <i>Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur o.y.</i>
                which\nletters can be rearranged to <i>Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum</i>.\nThese two Latin
                sentences translate respectively as\n"I am now bringing these unripe things together in vain, Oy!"
                and\n"The mother of love [Venus] copies the forms of Cynthia [the Moon].")\n
            <p>Galileo\'s contributions outside physics and astronomy\nwere also enormous:\nHe made discoveries with the
                microscope he invented, and\nmade several important contributions to the early\ndevelopment of
                biology.\nPerhaps Galileo\'s most important contribution\nwas the <i>Doctrine of Uniformity</i>, the
                postulate that\nthere are <i>universal</i> laws of mechanics, in contrast to\nAristotelian and religious
                notions\nof separate laws for heaven and earth.\n\n
            <p>Galileo is often called the "Father of Modern Science"\nbecause of his emphasis on experimentation.\nHis
                use of a ramp to discover his Law of Falling Bodies\nwas ingenious.\n(For his experiments he started
                with a water-clock to measure time,\nbut found the beats reproduced by trained musicians to be more
                convenient.)\nHe understood that results needed to be repeated and averaged\n(he minimized mean
                absolute-error for his curve-fitting \ncriterion, two centuries before Gauss and Legendre
                introduced\nthe mean squared-error criterion).\nFor his experimental methods and discoveries,\nhis laws
                of motion, and for (eventually) helping\nto spread Copernicus\' heliocentrism, Galileo may have
                been\nthe most influential scientist ever; he\nranks #12 on Hart\'s list of the Most Influential Persons
                in History.\n(Despite these comments, it does appear that Galileo ignored\nexperimental results that
                conflicted with his theories.\nFor example, the Law of the Pendulum, based on Galileo\'s
                incorrect\nbelief that the tautochrone was the circle, conflicted\nwith his own observations.\nSome of
                his other ideas were wrong; for example, he dismissed Kepler\'s\nelliptical orbits and notion of
                gravitation and published a\nvery faulty explanation of tides.)\nDespite his extreme importance to
                mathematical physics,\nGalileo doesn\'t usually appear on\nlists of greatest <i>mathematicians</i>.\nHowever,
                Galileo did do work in pure mathematics;\nhe derived certain centroids and the parabolic shape\nof
                trajectories using a rudimentary calculus,\nand mentored Bonaventura Cavalieri, who extended Galileo\'s
                calculus;\nhe named (and may have been first to discover) the cycloid curve.\nMoreover, Galileo was one
                of the first to write about\ninfinite equinumerosity (the "Hilbert\'s Hotel Paradox").\nGalileo once
                wrote "Mathematics is the language in which God has written the\nuniverse."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Kepler was interested in astronomy from an early age,\nstudied to become a Lutheran
                    minister,\nbecame a professor of mathematics instead, then Tycho Brahe\'s understudy,\nand, on
                    Brahe\'s death, was appointed Imperial Mathematician at\nthe age of twenty-nine.\nHis observations
                    of the planets with Brahe, along with his study\nof Apollonius\' 1800-year old work, led to
                    Kepler\'s three Laws\nof Planetary Motion, which in turn led directly to Newton\'s\nLaws of
                    Motion.\nBeyond his discovery of these Laws (one of the most important\nachievements in all of
                    science), Kepler is also sometimes called\nthe "Founder of Modern Optics."\nHe furthered the theory
                    of the camera obscura,\ntelescopes built from <i>two</i> convex lenses,\nand atmospheric
                    refraction.\nThe question of human vision had been\nconsidered by many great scientists including
                    Aristotle, Euclid,\nPtolemy, Galen, Alkindus, Alhazen, and Leonardo da Vinci,\nbut it was Kepler who
                    was first to explain the\noperation of the human eye correctly and to note that retinal\nimages will
                    be upside-down.\nKepler developed a rudimentary notion of universal gravitation,\nand used it to
                    produce the best explanation for tides before Newton;\nhowever he seems not to have noticed that his
                    empirical laws\nimplied inverse-square gravitation.\nKepler noticed Olbers\' Paradox before Olbers\'
                    time and used it\nto conclude that the Universe is finite.\nKepler ranks #75 on Michael Hart\'s
                    famous list of\nthe Most Influential Persons in History. This rank, much lower than\nthat of
                    Copernicus, Galileo or Newton, seems to me to underestimate Kepler\'s\nimportance, since it was
                    Kepler\'s Laws, rather than just heliocentrism,\nwhich were essential to the early development of
                    mathematical physics.\n\n
            <p>According to Kepler\'s Laws, the planets move at variable speed\nalong ellipses.\n(Even Copernicus
                thought the orbits could be described with only circles.)\nThe Earth-bound observer is himself
                describing\nsuch an orbit and in almost the same plane as the planets;\nthus discovering the Laws would
                be a difficult challenge even for\nsomeone armed with computers and modern mathematics.\n(The very
                famous Kepler Equation relating a planet\'s\neccentric and anomaly is just one tool Kepler needed to
                develop.)\nKepler understood the importance of his remarkable discovery, even if\ncontemporaries like
                Galileo did not, writing:\n
            <blockquote>\n"I give myself up to divine ecstasy ... My book is written.\nIt will be read either by my
                contemporaries or by posterity &mdash;\nI care not which. It may well wait a hundred years for
                a\nreader, as God has waited 6,000 years for someone to\nunderstand His work."\n
            </blockquote>
            \nKepler also once wrote "Mathematics is the archetype of the\nbeautiful."\n\n<p>Besides the trigonometric
                results needed to discover his Laws,\nKepler made other contributions to mathematics.\nHe generalized
                Alhazen\'s Billiard Problem, developing the\nnotion of curvature.\nHe was first to notice that the set
                of Platonic regular solids\nwas incomplete if concave solids are admitted, and first\nto prove that
                there were only 13 <i>Archimedean solids</i>.\nHe proved theorems of solid geometry later discovered
                on\nthe famous palimpsest of Archimedes.\nHe rediscovered the Fibonacci series, applied it to\nbotany,
                and noted that the ratio of Fibonacci numbers\nconverges to the <i>Golden Mean</i>.\nHe was a key early
                pioneer in calculus,\nand embraced the concept of continuity\n(which others avoided due to Zeno\'s
                paradoxes);\nhis work was a direct inspiration for Cavalieri and others.\nHe developed the theory of
                logarithms and improved on\nNapier\'s tables.\nHe developed mensuration methods and\nanticipated
                Fermat\'s theorem on stationary points.\nKepler once had an opportunity to buy wine, which merchants
                measured\nusing a shortcut; with the famous <i>Kepler\'s Wine Barrel Problem</i>,\nhe used his
                rudimentary calculus to deduce which barrel shape\nwould be the best bargain.\n\n
            <p>Kepler reasoned that the structure of snowflakes was evidence\nfor the then-novel atomic theory of
                matter.\nHe noted that the obvious packing of cannonballs gave maximum\ndensity (this became known as
                <i>Kepler\'s Conjecture</i>; optimality\nwas proved among regular packings by Gauss, but it wasn\'t
                until\n1998 that the possibility of denser <i>irregular</i> packings\nwas disproven).\nIn addition to
                his physics and mathematics,\nKepler wrote a science fiction novel,\nand was an astrologer and
                mystic.\nHe had ideas similar to Pythagoras about numbers ruling the\ncosmos (writing that the purpose
                of studying the world\n"should be to discover the rational order and harmony which\nhas been imposed on
                it by God and which He revealed to us in the language of\nmathematics").\nKepler\'s mystic beliefs even
                led to his own mother being\nimprisoned for witchcraft.\n\n
            <p>Johannes Kepler (along with Galileo, Fermat,\nHuygens, Wallis, Vieta and Descartes)\nis among the giants
                on whose shoulders Newton was proud to stand.\nSome historians place him ahead of Galileo and Copernicus
                as the single most\nimportant contributor to the early Scientific Revolution.\nChasles includes Kepler
                on a list of the six responsible for\nconceiving and perfecting infinitesimal calculus (the other five
                are\nArchimedes, Cavalieri, Fermat, Leibniz and Newton).\n(<a href="http://www.keplersdiscovery.com/">www.keplersdiscovery.com</a>\nis

                        kissing circles</i>,\nhis theorem on total angular defect (an early form of\nthe Gauss-Bonnet
                    result so key to much mathematics),\nand an improved solution to the Delian problem
                    (cube-doubling).\nWhile studying lens refraction,\nhe invented the <i>Ovals of Descartes</i>.\nHe
                    improved mathematical notation\n(e.g. the use of superscripts to denote exponents).\nHe also
                    discovered Euler\'s Polyhedral Theorem, <b>F+V = E+2</b>.\nDescartes was very influential in physics
                    and biology as well,\ne.g. developing laws of motion which included a "vortex" theory of
                    gravitation;\nbut most of his scientific work outside mathematics was eventually\nfound to be
                    incorrect.\n\n
            <p>Descartes has an extremely high reputation and would\nbe ranked even higher by many list makers, but
                whatever his\nhistorical importance his mathematical skill was not in the\ntop rank. Some of his work
                was borrowed from others,\ne.g. from Thomas Harriot.\nHe had only insulting things to say about Pascal
                and Fermat,\neach of whom was much more\nbrilliant at mathematics than Descartes.\n(Some even suspect
                that Descartes arranged the destruction\nof Pascal\'s lost <i>Essay on Conics</i>.)\nAnd Descartes made
                numerous errors in his development of\nphysics, perhaps even delaying science,\nwith Huygens writing "in
                all of [Descartes\'] physics,\nI find almost nothing to which I can subscribe as being correct."\nEven
                the historical importance of his mathematics\nmay be somewhat exaggerated since others, e.g.\nFermat,
                Wallis and Cavalieri, were making similar discoveries\nindependently.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Pierre de Fermat was the most brilliant mathematician\nof his era and, along with Descartes,
                    one of the most influential.\nAlthough mathematics was just his hobby (Fermat was a government
                    lawyer),\nFermat practically founded Number Theory, and also played key\nroles in the discoveries of
                    Analytic Geometry and Calculus.\nLagrange considered Fermat, rather than Newton or Leibniz, to be
                    the \ninventor of calculus.\nFermat was first to study certain interesting curves,\ne.g. the <i>"Witch
                        of Agnesi"</i>.\nHe was also an excellent geometer (e.g. discovering a\ntriangle\'s <i>Fermat
                        point</i>),\nand (in collaboration with Blaise Pascal) discovered probability theory.\nFellow
                    geniuses are the best judges of genius, and Blaise\nPascal had this to say of Fermat:\n"For my part,
                    I confess that [Fermat\'s researches about numbers]\nare far beyond me, and I am competent only to
                    admire them."\nE.T. Bell wrote "it can be argued that Fermat was\nat least Newton\'s equal as a pure
                    mathematician."\n\n
            <p>Fermat\'s most famous discoveries in number theory\ninclude the ubiquitously-used <i>Fermat\'s Little
                Theorem</i>\n(that <i>(a<sup>p</sup>-a)</i> is a multiple of <i>p</i>\nwhenever <i>p</i> is prime);\nthe
                <i>n = 4</i> case of\nhis conjectured <i>Fermat\'s Last Theorem</i> (he may have\nproved the <i>n =
                    3</i> case as well);\nand <i>Fermat\'s Christmas Theorem</i>\n(that any prime (4n+1) can be
                represented as the sum of two\nsquares in exactly one way) which may be considered the\nmost difficult
                theorem of arithmetic which had been\nproved up to that date.\nFermat proved the Christmas Theorem with
                difficulty\nusing "infinite descent," but details are unrecorded, so the\ntheorem is often named the <i>Fermat-Euler
                    Prime Number Theorem</i>,\nwith the first published proof being by Euler more than a century
                after\nFermat\'s claim.\nAnother famous conjecture by Fermat is that\nevery natural number is the sum of
                three triangle numbers,\nor more generally the sum of k k-gonal numbers.\nAs with his "Last Theorem" he
                claimed to have a proof but\ndidn\'t write it up.\n(This theorem was eventually proved by Lagrange for
                k=4,\nthe very young Gauss for k=3, and Cauchy for general k.\nDiophantus claimed the k=4 case but any
                proof has been lost.)\nI think Fermat\'s conjectures were impressive even if unproven,\nand that this
                great mathematician is often underrated.\n(Recall that his so-called "Last Theorem"\nwas actually just a
                private scribble.)\n\n
            <p>Fermat developed a system of analytic geometry which both\npreceded and surpassed that of Descartes; he
                developed methods of\ndifferential and integral calculus which Newton\nacknowledged as an
                inspiration.\nAlthough Kepler anticipated it, Fermat is credited with Fermat\'s\nTheorem on Stationary
                Points (<i>df(x)/dx = 0</i> at function extrema),\nthe key to many problems in applied analysis.\nFermat
                was also the first European to find the integration\nformula for the general polynomial; he used his
                calculus\nto find centers of gravity, etc.\n\n
            <p>Fermat\'s contemporaneous rival Ren&eacute; Descartes is more famous\nthan Fermat, and Descartes\'
                writings were more influential.\nWhatever one thinks of Descartes as a <i>philosopher</i>,\nhowever, it
                seems clear that Fermat was the better <i>mathematician</i>.\nFermat and Descartes did work in physics
                and independently discovered\nthe (trigonometric) law of refraction,\nbut Fermat gave the correct
                explanation, and used it\nremarkably to anticipate the Principle of Least Action\nlater enunciated by
                Maupertuis (though Maupertuis\nhimself, like Descartes, had an incorrect explanation of
                refraction).\nFermat and Descartes independently discovered analytic geometry,\nbut it was Fermat who
                extended it to more than\ntwo dimensions, and followed up by developing elementary
                calculus.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                which were also credited to Pascal and Torricelli.\nSome of these methods, published posthumously, led
                to him being called the\nFounder of Kinematic Geometry.\nHe excelled at mechanics,\nworked in

                impossible).\n(Descartes conjectured, and Pascal later confirmed, that this same\ndevice could also be

                drains through a small hole with rate\nproportional to the square root of water depth). \nIn
                mathematics, he applied Cavalieri\'s methods to\nsolve difficult mensuration problems; he also wrote on

                first Torricelli guessed it was a mistake, just another pitfall\nof calculus, though he later accepted
                its validity.)\nHe also solved a problem due to Fermat by locating the isogonic center of\na

                    student (he may have contributed to the concept\nof blood circulation), and theologian, but went on
                    to become perhaps the most\nbrilliant and influential English mathematician before Newton.\nHe made
                    major advances in analytic geometry, but also\ncontributions to algebra, geometry and
                    trigonometry.\nUnlike his contemporary Huygens, who took inspiration from\nEuclid\'s rigorous
                    geometry, Wallis embraced the new analytic methods\nof Descartes and Fermat.\nHe is especially
                    famous for using negative and fractional exponents\n(though Oresme had introduced fractional
                    exponents three centuries earlier),\ntaking the areas of curves, and treating inelastic
                    collisions\n(he and Huygens were first to develop the law of momentum conservation).\nHe was a
                    polymath; his non-mathematical work included a highly\nrespected English grammar; he introduced the

                (and used <b>1/&infin;</b> to denote\ninfinitesimal).\nWallis coined several terms including

                    excellent mathematician, he\nis much more famous for his physical theories and inventions.\nHe
                    developed laws of motion before Newton, including\nthe inverse-square law of gravitation,
                    centripetal force,\nand treatment of solid bodies rather than point approximations;\nhe (and Wallis)
                    were first to state the law of momentum conservation correctly.\nHe advanced the wave ("undulatory")
                    theory of light,\na key concept being <i>Huygen\'s Principle</i>, that each point on a wave
                    front\nacts as a new source of radiation.\nHis optical discoveries include explanations for
                    polarization\nand phenomena like haloes.\n(Because of Newton\'s high reputation and\ncorpuscular
                    theory of light, Huygens\' superior wave theory\nwas largely ignored until the 19th-century work of
                    Young, Fresnel,\nand Maxwell.\nLater, Planck, Einstein and Bohr, partly anticipated by
                    Hamilton,\ndeveloped the modern notion of wave-particle duality.)\n\n
            <p>Huygens is famous for his inventions of clocks and lenses.\nHe invented the escapement and other
                mechanisms, leading to the\nfirst reliable pendulum clock; he built the first\nbalance spring watch,
                which he presented to his\npatron, King Louis XIV of France; he was first to give the\ncorrect "equation
                of time" relating sundial time to\nabsolute time.\nHe invented superior lens grinding techniques,\nthe
                achromatic eye-piece, and the best telescope of his day.\nHe was himself a famous astronomer:\nhe
                discovered Titan and was first to\nproperly describe Saturn\'s rings and the Orion Nebula.\nHe also
                designed, but never built, an internal combustion engine.\nHe promoted the use of an equal-tempered
                31-tone music scale\nto avoid the tuning errors in Stevin\'s 12-tone scale;\na 31-tone organ was in use
                in Holland as late as the 20th century.\nHuygens was an excellent card player, billiard player,\nhorse
                rider, and wrote a book speculating about extra-terrestrial life.\n\n
            <p>As a mathematician, Huygens did brilliant work in analysis;\nhis calculus, along with that of Wallis, is
                considered the\nbest prior to Newton and Leibniz.\nHe also did brilliant work in geometry,\nproving
                theorems about conic sections, the cycloid and the catenary.\nHe was first to show that the cycloid
                solves the tautochrone\nproblem; he used this fact to design\npendulum clocks that would be more
                accurate\nthan ordinary pendulum clocks.\nHe was first to find the flaw in Saint-Vincent\'s\nthen-famous
                circle-squaring method;\nHuygens himself solved some related quadrature problems.\nHe introduced the
                concepts of evolute and involute.\nHis friendships with Descartes, Pascal, Mersenne and others
                helped\ninspire his mathematics; Huygens in turn was inspirational\nto the next generation.\nAt
                Pascal\'s urging, Huygens published the first real\ntextbook on probability theory; he also\nbecame the
                first practicing actuary.\n\n
            <p>Huygens had tremendous creativity, historical importance,\nand depth and breadth of genius, both in
                physics and mathematics.\nHe also was important for serving as tutor\nto the otherwise self-taught
                Gottfried Leibniz\n(who\'d "wasted his youth" without learning any math).\nBefore agreeing to tutor
                him,\nHuygens tested the 25-year old Leibniz by asking him\nto sum the reciprocals of the triangle
                numbers.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>\nJames Gregory (Gregorie) was the outstanding Scottish genius of his century.\nHad he not
                    died at the age of 36, or if he had published more of his work,\n(or if Newton had never lived,)
                    Gregory would surely be appreciated\nas one of the greatest mathematicians of the early Age of
                    Science.\nInspired by Kepler\'s work, he worked in mechanics and optics; invented\na reflecting
                    telescope; and is even\ncredited with using a bird feather as the first diffraction grating.\nBut
                    James Gregory is most famous for his mathematics, making\nmany of the same discoveries as Newton
                    did:\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,\ninterpolation method, and binomial theorem.\nHe
                    developed the concept of Taylor\'s series and used it to\nsolve a famous semicircle division problem
                    posed by Kepler\nand to develop trigonometric identities, including\n<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    <b><i>tan</i><sup>-1</sup>x = x &nbsp; - &nbsp; x<sup>3</sup>/3 &nbsp; + &nbsp; x<sup>5</sup>/5

                    anticipated Cauchy\'s convergence test, Newton\'s identities\nfor the powers of roots, and Riemann
                    integration.\nHe may have been first to suspect that quintics generally lacked\nalgebraic solutions,
                    as well as that <b><i>&pi;</i></b> and <b><i>e</i></b> were\ntranscendental.\nHe produced a partial
                    proof that the ancient "Squaring the Circle"\nproblem was impossible.\n
            <p>Gregory declined to publish much of his work, partly in deference\nto Isaac Newton who was making many of
                the same discoveries.\nBecause the wide range of his mathematics wasn\'t appreciated until long
                after\nhis death, Gregory lacks the historic importance to qualify for the Top 100.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>\n
            <p>Newton was an industrious lad who built marvelous toys\n(e.g. a model windmill powered by a mouse on
                treadmill).\nAt about age 22, on leave from University, this genius began\nrevolutionary advances in
                mathematics, optics, dynamics,\nthermodynamics, acoustics and celestial mechanics.\nHe is famous for his
                Three Laws of Motion\n(inertia, force, reciprocal action) but, as\nNewton himself acknowledged, these
                Laws weren\'t fully novel:\nHipparchus, Ibn al-Haytham, Descartes, Galileo and Huygens had
                all\ndeveloped much basic mechanics already; and Newton credits the First Law\nto Aristotle.\nHowever
                Newton was apparently the first person to conclude\nthat the ordinary gravity we observe on Earth is the
                very same\nforce that keeps the planets in orbit.\nHis Law of Universal Gravitation was revolutionary
                and due to\nNewton alone.\n(Christiaan Huygens, the other great mechanist of the era,\nhad independently
                deduced that Kepler\'s laws imply inverse-square\ngravitation, but he considered the action at a
                distance in\nNewton\'s theory to be "absurd.")\nNewton published the Cooling Law of thermodynamics.\nHe
                also made contributions to chemistry, and was \nthe important early advocate of the atomic theory.\nHis
                writings also made important contributions\nto the general scientific method.\nHis other intellectual
                interests included theology,\nand mysticism.\nHe studied ancient Greek writers like
                Pythagoras,\nDemocritus, Lucretius, Plato; and claimed that the\nancients knew much, including the law
                of gravitation.\n\n
            <p>Although this list is concerned only with mathematics,\nNewton\'s greatness is indicated by the huge
                range of his\nphysics: even without his Laws of Motion, Gravitation and Cooling,\nhe\'d be famous just
                for his revolutionary work in optics, where\nhe explained diffraction, observed\nthat white light is a
                mixture of all the rainbow\'s colors,\nnoted that purple is created by combining red and\nblue light
                and, starting from that observation, \nwas first to conceive of a color hue "wheel."\n(The mystery of
                the rainbow had been solved by earlier\nmathematicians like Al-Farisi and Descartes, but\nNewton
                improved on their explanations. Most people\nwould count only six colors in the rainbow but, due
                to\nNewton\'s influence, seven -- a number with mystic importance --\nis the accepted number.
                Supernumerary rainbows, by the way,\nwere not explained until the wave theory of light
                superseded\nNewton\'s theory.)\nHe noted that his dynamical laws were symmetric in time; that\njust as
                the past determines the future, so the\nfuture might, in principle, determine the past.\nNewton almost
                anticipated Einstein\'s mass-energy equivalence,\nwriting "Gross Bodies and Light are convertible into
                one another...\n[Nature] seems delighted with Transmutations."\nOcean tides had intrigued several of
                Newton\'s predecessors; once\ngravitation was known, the Moon\'s gravitational attraction\nprovided the
                explanation -- except that there are <i>two</i> high\ntides per day, one when the Moon is farthest
                away.\nWith clear thinking the second high tide is also explained by gravity\nbut who was the first
                clear thinker to produce that explanation?\nYou guessed it! Isaac Newton.\n(The theory of tides was
                later refined by Laplace.)\nNewton\'s earliest fame came when he discovered the problem of\nchromatic
                aberration in lenses, and designed the first reflecting telescope\nto counteract that aberration; his
                were the best telescopes of that era.\nHe also designed the first reflecting microscope, and the
                sextant.\n\n
            <p>Although others also developed the techniques independently,\nNewton is regarded as the "Father of
                Calculus" (which he called\n"fluxions"); he shares credit with Leibniz for the\nFundamental Theorem of
                Calculus\n(that integration and differentiation are each other\'s inverse operation).\nHe applied
                calculus for several purposes:\nfinding areas, tangents, the lengths of\ncurves and the maxima and
                minima of functions.\nAlthough Descartes is renowned as the inventor of analytic geometry,\nhe and
                followers like Wallis were reluctant even to use negative\ncoordinates, so one historian declares Newton
                to be "the first\nto work boldly with algebraic equations."\nIn addition to several other important
                advances in analytic geometry,\nhis mathematical works include the Binomial Theorem,\nhis eponymous
                interpolation method,\nthe idea of polar coordinates,\nand power series for exponential and
                trigonometric functions.\n(The equation &nbsp;\n<b><i>e</i><sup>x</sup> = <i>&sum;</i> x<sup>k</sup> /
                    k!</b> &nbsp;\nhas been attributed to Newton and called the "most important series in\nmathematics,"
                but, although he published some related trignometric\nformulae, he doesn\'t seem to have published the
                exponential\nseries explicitly priopr to Bernoulli\'s discoveries circa 1690.)\nHe contributed to
                algebra and the theory of equations;\nhe was first to state B&eacute;zout\'s Theorem;\nhe generalized
                Descartes\' rule of signs.\n(The generalized rule of signs was incomplete and finally\nresolved two
                centuries later by Sturm and Sylvester.)\nHe developed a series for the arcsin function.\nHe developed
                facts about cubic equations\n(just as the "shadows of a cone" yield all quadratic curves,\nNewton found
                a curve whose "shadows" yield all cubic curves).\nHe proved, using a purely geometric argument of
                awesome ingenuity,\nthat same-mass spheres (or hollowed spheres) of any radius have equal\ngravitational
                attraction: this fact is key to celestial motions.\n(He also proved that objects <i>inside</i> a
                hollowed sphere\nexperience zero net attraction.)\nHe discovered Puiseux series almost two centuries
                before they\nwere re-invented by Puiseux.\n(Like some of the greatest ancient mathematicians,\nNewton
                took the time to compute an approximation to\n<b>&pi;</b>; his was better than Vieta\'s, though
                still\nnot as accurate as al-Kashi\'s.)\n\n
            <p>Newton is so famous for his calculus, optics, and laws of\ngravitation and motion, it is easy to overlook
                that he was also one of the\nvery greatest geometers.\nHe was first to fully solve\nthe famous Problem
                of Pappus, and did so with pure geometry.\nBuilding on the "neusis" (non-Platonic) constructions of
                Archimedes\nand Pappus, he demonstrated cube-doubling and that angles\ncould be <i>k</i>-sected for any
                <i>k</i>, if one is allowed a conchoid or\ncertain other mechanical curves.\nHe also built on
                Apollonius\' famous\ntheorem about tangent circles to develop the technique\nnow called hyperbolic
                trilateration.\nDespite the power of Descartes\' analytic geometry,\nNewton\'s achievements with
                synthetic geometry were surpassing.\nEven before the invention of the calculus of variations,
                Newton\nwas doing difficult work in that field, e.g.\nhis calculation of the "optimal bullet
                shape."\nHis other marvelous geometric theorems included several about quadrilaterals\nand their in- or
                circum-scribing ellipses.\nHe constructed the parabola defined by four given points,\nas well as various
                cubic curve constructions.\n(As with Archimedes, many of \nNewton\'s constructions used non-Platonic
                tools.)\nHe anticipated Poncelet\'s Principle of Continuity.\nAn anecdote often cited to demonstrate his
                brilliance is the problem\nof the <i>brachistochrone</i>, which had baffled the best mathematicians
                in\nEurope, and came to Newton\'s attention late in life.\nHe solved it in a few hours and published the
                answer anonymously.\nBut on seeing the solution Jacob Bernoulli immediately exclaimed\n"I recognize the
                lion by his footprint."\n\n
            <p>In 1687 Newton published&nbsp;\n<i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>, surely\nthe greatest
                scientific book ever written.\nThe motion of the planets was not understood before Newton,\nalthough the
                <i>heliocentric</i> system allowed Kepler to describe the\norbits.\nIn <i>Principia</i> Newton analyzed
                the consequences of his Laws of Motion\nand introduced the Law of Universal Gravitation.\nWith the key
                mystery of celestial motions finally resolved,\nthe Great Scientific Revolution began.\n(In his work
                Newton also proved important theorems about inverse-<i>cube</i>\nforces, work largely unappreciated
                until Chandrasekhar\'s modern-day work.)\nNewton once wrote "Truth is ever to be found in the
                simplicity,\nand not in the multiplicity and confusion of things."\nSir Isaac Newton was buried at
                Westminster Abbey in a tomb\ninscribed "Let mortals rejoice that so great an ornament to the human\nrace
                has existed."\n\n
            <p>Newton ranks #2 on Michael Hart\'s famous list of\nthe Most Influential Persons in History.\n(Muhammed
                the Prophet of Allah is #1.)\nWhatever the criteria, Newton would certainly rank first\nor second on any
                list of physicists, or scientists in general,\nbut some listmakers would demote him slightly on a list
                of\npure mathematicians:\nhis emphasis was physics not mathematics,\nand the contribution of
                Leibniz\n(Newton\'s rival for the title <i>Inventor of Calculus</i>)\nlessens the historical importance
                of Newton\'s calculus.\nOne reason I\'ve ranked him at #1 is a comment by\nGottfried Leibniz
                himself:\n"Taking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the time when\nNewton lived, what he
                has done is much the better part."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Leibniz was one of the most brilliant and prolific\nintellectuals ever; and his influence in
                    mathematics (especially\nhis co-invention of the infinitesimal calculus) was immense.\nHis childhood
                    IQ has been estimated as second-highest in all of history,\nbehind only Goethe\'s.\nDescriptions
                    which have been applied to Leibniz include\n"one of the two greatest universal geniuses" (da Vinci
                    was\nthe other); "the most important logician between Aristotle and Boole;"\nand the "Father of
                    Applied Science."\nLeibniz described himself as "the most teachable of mortals."\n\n
            <p>Mathematics was just a self-taught sideline for Leibniz, who was\na philosopher, lawyer, historian,
                diplomat and renowned inventor.\nBecause he "wasted his youth" before learning mathematics,\nhe probably
                ranked behind the Bernoullis as well as Newton\nin pure mathematical talent, and thus he may be the
                only\nmathematician among the Top Fifteen who was never the greatest\nliving algorist or theorem
                prover.\nI won\'t try to summarize Leibniz\' contributions to philosophy\nand diverse other fields
                including biology; as just\nthree examples: he predicted the Earth\'s molten core,\nintroduced the
                notion of subconscious mind,\nand built the first calculator that could do multiplication.\nLeibniz also
                had political influence: he\nconsulted to both the Holy Roman and Russian Emperors;\nanother of his
                patrons was Sophia Wittelsbach (Electress of Hanover),\nwho was only distantly in\nline for the British
                throne, but was made Heir Presumptive.\n(Sophia died before Queen Anne, but her son\nwas crowned King
                George I of England.)\n\n
            <p>Leibniz pioneered the common discourse of mathematics,\nincluding its continuous, discrete, and symbolic
                aspects.\n(His ideas on symbolic logic weren\'t pursued and it was left\nto Boole to reinvent this
                almost two centuries later.)\nMathematical innovations attributed to Leibniz include\nthe notations
                &int;<b>f(x)<i>d</i>x</b>,\n<b><i>d</i>f(x)/<i>d</i>x</b>, <b>&#8731;x</b>,\nand even the use of <b><i>a&middot;b</i></b>
                (instead of\n<b><i>a</i> X </i>b</b></i>) for multiplication;\nthe concepts of matrix determinant and
                Gaussian elimination;\nthe theory of geometric envelopes;\nand the binary number system.\nHe worked in
                number theory, conjecturing Wilson\'s Theorem.\nHe invented more mathematical terms than anyone,
                including\n<i>function</i>, <i>analysis situ</i>, <i>variable</i>, <i>abscissa</i>,\n<i>parameter</i>
                and <i>coordinate</i>.\nHe also coined the word <i>transcendental</i>, proving that\nsin() was not an
                algebraic function.\nHis works seem to anticipate cybernetics and information theory;\nand Mandelbrot
                acknowledged Leibniz\' anticipation of self-similarity.\nLike Newton, Leibniz discovered The Fundamental
                Theorem of Calculus;\nhis contribution to calculus was much more influential than Newton\'s,\nand his
                superior notation is used to this day.\nAs Leibniz himself pointed out, since the concept
                of\nmathematical analysis was already known to ancient Greeks,\nthe revolutionary invention was the <u>notation</u>
                ("<i>calculus</i>"),\nbecause with "symbols [which] express the exact nature of a\nthing briefly ... the
                labor of thought is wonderfully diminished."\n\n
            <p>Leibniz\' thoughts on mathematical physics had some influence.\nHe was one of the first to articulate the
                law of energy\nconservation and may have written on the principle of least action.\nHe developed laws of
                motion that gave different insights\nfrom those of Newton; his views on cosmology anticipated
                theories\nof Mach and Einstein and are more in accord with modern\nphysics than are Newton\'s
                views.\nMathematical physicists influenced by Leibniz include not only Mach,\nbut perhaps Hamilton and
                Poincar&eacute; themselves.\n\n
            <p>Although others found it independently\n(including perhaps Madhava three centuries earlier),\nLeibniz
                discovered and proved a striking identity\nfor <b>&pi;</b>:\n<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<b><i>&pi;</i>/4
                    = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...</b>\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    tutored each other.\nJacob developed important methods for integral\nand differential equations,
                    coining the word <i>integral</i>.\nHe and his brother were the key pioneers in mathematics during

            <p>Jacob liked to pose and solve physical optimization problems.\nHis "catenary" problem (what shape does a
                clothesline take?)\nbecame more famous than the "tautochrone" solved by Huygens.\nPerhaps the most
                famous of such problems\nwas the brachistochrone, wherein Jacob recognized\nNewton\'s "lion\'s paw", and
                about which Johann Bernoulli wrote:\n"You will be petrified with astonishment [that]\nthis same cycloid,
                the tautochrone of Huygens,\nis the brachistochrone we are seeking."\nJacob did significant work outside
                calculus;\nin fact his most famous work was the <i>Art of Conjecture</i>,\na textbook on probability and
                combinatorics which\nproves the Law of Large Numbers, the Power Series Equation,\nand introduces the

                of his famous results duplicated work by others:\nMaclaurin\'s Series was just a form of Taylor\'s
                series; the Euler-Maclaurin\nSummation Formula was also discovered by Euler;\nand he discovered the

                    methods in many areas are in use to this day.\nEuler was the most prolific mathematician in
                    history\nand is often judged to be the best algorist of all time.\n(This brief summary can only
                    touch on a few highlights of Euler\'s work.\nThe ranking #4 may seem too low for this supreme
                    mathematician,\nbut Gauss succeeded at proving several theorems which had stumped Euler.)\n\n
            <p>Just as Archimedes extended Euclid\'s geometry to marvelous heights, so\nEuler took marvelous advantage
                of the analysis\nof Newton and Leibniz.\nHe also gave the world modern trigonometry;\npioneered (along
                with Lagrange) the calculus of variations;\ngeneralized and proved the Newton-Giraud formulae;\nand made
                important contributions to algebra,\ne.g. his study of hypergeometric series.\nHe was also supreme at
                discrete mathematics,\ninventing graph theory.\nHe also invented the concept of generating functions;
                for example,\nletting p(n) denote the number of partitions of n, Euler found \nthe lovely equation:
                &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<b>&Sigma;<sub>n</sub> <i>p</i>(n) x<sup>n</sup>\n= 1 / &Pi;<sub>k</sub> (1 -

                all have the <b>(3m<sup>2</sup>+m)/2</b>\n"pentagonal number" form; Euler found an ingenious proof of
                this.\nEuler wrote the first definitive treatise on continued fractions,\nestablishing several key
                theorems on that important topic.\n\n
            <p>Euler was a very major figure in number theory: He proved that the\nsum of the reciprocals of primes less

                Euclid had\ndiscovered 2000 years earlier, and much more.\nEuler was also first to prove several
                interesting theorems\nof geometry, including facts about the <i>9-point Feuerbach circle</i>;\nrelationships
                among a triangle\'s altitudes, medians, and\ncircumscribing and inscribing circles;\nthe famous
                Intersecting Chords Theorem;\nand an expression for a tetrahedron\'s volume in terms of its edge
                lengths.\nEuler was first to explore topology, proving theorems\nabout the <i>Euler characteristic</i>,
                and the famous\nEuler\'s Polyhedral Theorem, <b>F+V = E+2</b> (although it may have\nbeen discovered by
                Descartes and first proved rigorously by Jordan).\nAlthough noted as the first great "pure
                mathematician,"\nEuler\'s pump and turbine equations revolutionized the design of pumps;\nhe also made
                important contributions to music theory,\nacoustics, optics, celestial motions, fluid dynamics, and
                mechanics.\nHe extended Newton\'s Laws of Motion to rotating rigid bodies;\nand developed the
                Euler-Bernoulli beam equation.\nOn a lighter note, Euler constructed a particularly\n"magical" magic
                square.\n\n

                arithmetic\ndispute involving 50 terms in a long convergent series.\nBoth these feats were accomplished
                when he was totally blind.\n(About this he said "Now I will have less distraction.")\nFran&ccedil;ois
                Arago said that "Euler calculated without apparent effort,\nas men breathe, or as eagles sustain

                Euler,\nalong with operators like <b><i>&Sigma;</i></b>.\nHe did important work with\n<i>Riemann\'s zeta

                    1+2+3+4+... = -1/12</b>.\nEuler started as a young student of the Bernoulli family,\nand was Daniel
                Bernoulli\'s roommate in Saint Petersburg,\nwhere Euler was first employed as a teacher of
                physiology.\nBut at age twenty-eight, Euler\ndiscovered the striking identity &nbsp;\n<b>&zeta;(2) = <i>&pi;</i><sup>2</sup>/6</b>
                &nbsp;\nThis catapulted Euler to instant fame, since the\nleft-side infinite sum (<i>1 + 1/4 + 1/9 +
                    1/16 + ...)</i>\nwas a famous problem of the time.\nEuler and others developed alternate proofs and
                generalizations\nof this "Basel problem," and of course the &zeta; (zeta) function\nis now very
                famous.\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3eB9sfls">Here\nis an elegant geometric proof for
                    this theorem.</a>\nAmong many other famous and important identities,\nEuler proved the Pentagonal
                Number Theorem alluded to above\n(a beautiful result which\nhas inspired a variety of discoveries), and
                the Euler Product Formula\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>&zeta;(s) = &prod;(1-p<sup>-s</sup>)<sup>-1</sup></b>\n&nbsp;

                functions:\n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<b><i>e</i><sup>i x</sup> = <i>cos</i> x + i <i>sin</i> x</b>.\n(It

                schools, and helped\ntranslate Newton\'s work into French.\nThe theories of Newton and Descartes gave
                different predictions\nfor the shape of the Earth (whether the poles were flattened or\npointy);
                Clairaut participated in Maupertuis\' expedition to Lappland to\nmeasure the polar
                regions.\nMeasurements at high latitudes showed the poles to be flattened:\nNewton was right.\nClairaut
                worked on the theories of ellipsoids and the three-body\nproblem, e.g. Moon\'s orbit.\nThat orbit was
                the major mathematical challenge of the day,\nand there was great difficulty reconciling theory and
                observation.\nIt was Clairaut who finally resolved this,\nby approaching the problem with more rigor
                than others.\nWhen Euler finally understood Clairaut\'s solution he called it\n"the most important and
                profound discovery that has ever\nbeen made in mathematics."\nLater, when Halley\'s Comet reappeared as
                he had predicted,\nClairaut was acclaimed as "the new Thales."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    differential equations;\nhis Method of Characteristics then reduced those equations\nto

                and was more nearly complete\nthan, the attempted proof by Euler-Lagrange.)\nHe also did creative\nwork
                in geometry (e.g. anticipating Monge\'s Three Circle Theorem),\nand was principal creator of the major
                encyclopedia of his day.\nD\'Alembert wrote "The imagination in a mathematician who creates\nmakes no

                    century.)\nHe also conjectured that\n<i><b>&pi;</b></i> and <i><b>e</b></i> were transcendental.\nHe
                    made advances in analysis (including the\nintroduction of <i>Lambert\'s W function</i>)\nand in
                    trigonometry (introducing\nthe hyperbolic functions <i>sinh</i> and <i>cosh</i>);\nproved a key
                    theorem of spherical trigonometry,\nand solved the "trinomial equation."\nLambert, whom Kant called
                    "the greatest genius of Germany,"\nwas an outstanding polymath: In addition to several areas of
                    mathematics,\nhe made contributions in philosophy, psychology,\ncosmology (conceiving of star
                    clusters, galaxies and supergalaxies),\nmap-making (inventing several distinct map
                    projections),\ninventions (he built the first practical hygrometer and photometer),\ndynamics, and
                    especially optics (several laws of optics carry his name).\n
            <p>Lambert is famous for his work in geometry,\nproving Lambert\'s Theorem (the path of rotation of\na
                parabola tangent triangle passes through the parabola\'s focus).\nLagrange declared this famous
                identity, used to calculate cometary orbits,\nto be the most beautiful and significant result in
                celestial motions.\nLambert was first to explore straight-edge constructions without compass.\nHe also
                developed non-Euclidean geometry, long before\nBolyai and Lobachevsky did.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Joseph-Louis Lagrange (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia)\nwas a brilliant man who advanced
                    to\nbecome a teen-age Professor shortly after first studying mathematics.\nHe excelled in all fields
                    of analysis and number theory;\nhe made key contributions to the theories of\ndeterminants,
                    continued fractions, and many other fields.\nHe developed partial differential equations far beyond
                    those\nof D. Bernoulli and d\'Alembert,\ndeveloped the calculus of variations far beyond that of the
                    Bernoullis,\ndiscovered the Laplace transform before Laplace did,\nand developed terminology
                    and\nnotation (e.g. the use of <i>f\'(x)</i> and <i>f\'\'(x)</i>\nfor a function\'s 1st and 2nd
                    derivatives).\nHe proved a fundamental Theorem of Group Theory.\nHe laid the foundations for the
                    theory of\npolynomial equations which Cauchy, Abel,\nGalois and Poincar&eacute; would later
                    complete.\nNumber theory was almost just a diversion for Lagrange,\nwhose focus was
                    analysis;\nnevertheless he was the master of that field as well,\nproving difficult and historic
                    theorems including\nWilson\'s Theorem (<b>p</b> divides <b>(p-1)! + 1</b>\nwhen p is
                    prime);\nLagrange\'s Four-Square Theorem (every positive integer is the\nsum of four squares);\nand

            <p>Lagrange\'s many contributions to physics\ninclude understanding of vibrations (he found\nan error in
                Newton\'s work and published the\ndefinitive treatise on sound), celestial mechanics\n(including an
                explanation of why the Moon keeps the same\nface pointed towards the Earth),\nthe <i>Principle of Least
                    Action</i>\n(which Hamilton compared to poetry), and the discovery of\nthe Lagrangian points (e.g.,
                in Jupiter\'s orbit).\nLagrange\'s textbooks were noted for clarity and inspired\nmost of the
                19th-century mathematicians on this list.\nUnlike Newton, who used calculus to derive his results but
                then worked\nbackwards to create geometric proofs for publication, Lagrange\nrelied only on
                analysis.\n"No diagrams will be found in this work" he wrote in the preface to his\nmasterpiece <i>M&eacute;canique
                    analytique</i>.\n\n
            <p>Lagrange once wrote "As long as algebra and geometry have been\nseparated, their progress have been slow
                and their uses limited;\nbut when these two sciences have been united, they have\nlent each mutual
                forces, and have marched together towards perfection."\nBoth W.W.R. Ball and E.T. Bell, renowned
                mathematical historians,\nbypass Euler to name Lagrange as "the Greatest\nMathematician of the 18th
                Century."\nJacobi bypassed Newton and Gauss to call Lagrange "perhaps the greatest\nmathematical genius

                <blockquote>Gaspard Monge, son of a humble peddler,\nwas an industrious and creative inventor\nwho
                    astounded early with his genius, becoming a professor of\nphysics at age 16.\nAs a military engineer
                    he developed the new field of descriptive geometry,\nso useful to engineering that it was kept a
                    military secret for 15 years.\nMonge made early discoveries in chemistry and helped
                    promote\nLavoisier\'s work;\nhe also wrote papers on optics and metallurgy;\nMonge\'s talents were
                    so diverse that he became Minister of the Navy\nin the revolutionary government, and eventually
                    became a close friend\nand companion of Napoleon Bonaparte.\nTraveling with Napoleon he demonstrated
                    great courage\non several occasions.\n\n
            <p>In mathematics, Monge is called the "Father of Differential Geometry,"\nand it is that foundational work
                for which he is most praised.\nHe also did work in discrete math, partial differential equations,\nand
                calculus of variations.\nHe anticipated Poncelet\'s Principle of Continuity.\nMonge\'s most famous
                theorems of geometry are the Three Circles Theorem\nand Four Spheres Theorem.\nHis early work in
                descriptive geometry has little interest to pure\nmathematics, but his application of calculus to
                the\ncurvature of surfaces inspired Gauss and eventually Riemann, and led\nthe great Lagrange to say
                "With [Monge\'s] application\nof analysis to geometry this devil of a man will make\nhimself
                immortal."\n\n
            <p>Monge was an inspirational teacher whose students included\nFourier, Chasles, Brianchon, Ampere,
                Carnot,\nPoncelet, several other famous mathematicians, and perhaps\nindirectly, Sophie
                Germain.\nChasles reports that Monge never drew figures in his lectures,\nbut could make "the most
                complicated forms appear in space ...\nwith no other aid than his hands, whose movements admirably
                supplemented\nhis words."\nThe contributions of Poncelet to synthetic geometry\nmay be more important
                than those\nof Monge, but Monge demonstrated great genius as an untutored child,\nwhile Poncelet\'s
                skills probably developed due to his great teacher.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Laplace was the preeminent mathematical astronomer,\nand is often called the "French
                    Newton."\nHis masterpiece was <i>M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste</i>\nwhich redeveloped and improved
                    Newton\'s work on planetary motions\nusing calculus.\nWhile Newton had shown that the two-body
                    gravitation problem\nled to orbits which were ellipses (or other conic sections),\nLaplace was more
                    interested in the much more difficult problems\ninvolving three or more bodies. (Would Jupiter\'s
                    pull on Saturn\neventually propel Saturn into a closer orbit, or was\nSaturn\'s orbit stable for
                    eternity?)\nLaplace\'s equations had the optimistic outcome that the solar\nsystem was stable.\n\n
            <p>Laplace advanced the nebular hypothesis of solar system origin, and\nwas first to conceive of black
                holes.\n(He also conceived of multiple galaxies,\nbut this was Lambert\'s idea first.)\nHe explained the
                so-called secular acceleration of the Moon.\n(Today we know Laplace\'s theories do not\nfully explain
                the Moon\'s path, nor guarantee orbit stability.)\nHis other accomplishments in physics include theories
                about\nthe speed of sound and surface tension.\nHe worked closely with Lavoisier, helping to discover
                the elemental\ncomposition of water, and the natures\nof combustion, respiration and heat
                itself.\nLaplace may have been first to note that the laws of mechanics\nare the same with time\'s arrow
                reversed.\nHe was noted for his strong belief in determinism, famously replying to\nNapoleon\'s question
                about God with: "I have no need of that hypothesis."\n\n
            <p>Laplace viewed mathematics as just a tool for developing his\nphysical theories.\nNevertheless, he made
                many important mathematical discoveries\nand inventions (although the Laplace Transform itself\nwas
                already known to Lagrange).\nHe was the premier expert at differential and difference equations,\nand
                definite integrals.\nHe developed spherical harmonics, potential theory, and the\ntheory of
                determinants; anticipated Fourier\'s series;\nand advanced Euler\'s technique of generating
                functions.\nIn the fields of probability and statistics he made key advances:\nhe proved the Law of
                Least Squares,\nand introduced the controversial ("Bayesian") rule of succession.\nIn the theory of
                equations, he was first to prove that\nany polynomial of even degree must have a real quadratic
                factor.\n\n
            <p>Others might place Laplace higher on the List,\nbut he proved no fundamental theorems of <i>pure</i>
                mathematics\n(though his partial differential equation for fluid dynamics\nis one of the most famous in
                physics),\nfounded no major branch of pure mathematics,\nand wasn\'t particularly concerned with
                rigorous proof.\n(He is famous for skipping difficult proof steps with the\nphrase "It is easy to
                see".)\nNevertheless he was surely one of the\ngreatest <i>applied</i> mathematicians
                ever.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Legendre was an outstanding mathematician who\ndid important work in plane and solid
                    geometry,\nspherical trigonometry,\ncelestial mechanics and other areas of physics,\nand especially
                    elliptic integrals and number theory.\nHe found key results in the theories of sums of squares
                    and\nsums of k-gonal numbers.\n(For example, he showed that all integers except <b>4<sup>k</sup>(8m+7)</b>\ncan
                    be expressed as the sum of three squares.)\nHe also made key contributions in several areas of
                    analysis:\nhe invented the Legendre transform and Legendre polynomials;\nthe notation for partial
                    derivatives is due to him.\nHe invented the Legendre symbol; invented the study of zonal
                    harmonics;\nproved that <b>&pi;<sup>2</sup></b> was\nirrational (the irrationality of <b>&pi;</b>\nhad
                    already been proved by Lambert);\nand wrote important textbooks in several fields.\nAlthough he
                    never accepted non-Euclidean geometry,\nand had spent much time trying to prove the Parallel
                    Postulate,\nhis inspiring geometry text remained a standard until the 20th century.\nAs one of
                    France\'s premier mathematicians, Legendre did other\nsignificant work, promoting the careers of
                    Lagrange and Laplace,\ndeveloping trig tables, geodesic projects, etc.\n\n
            <p>There are several important theorems proposed by Legendre\nfor which he is denied credit, either because
                his proof was\nincomplete or was preceded by another\'s.\nHe proposed the famous theorem about primes in
                a\nprogression which was proved by Dirichlet; proved and used the\nLaw of Least Squares which Gauss had
                left unpublished;\nproved the N=5 case of Fermat\'s Last Theorem which is credited\nto Dirichlet;
                proposed the famous Prime Number Theorem\nwhich was finally proved by Hadamard;\nimproved the
                Fermat-Cauchy result about\nsums of k-gonal numbers but this topic wasn\'t fruitful;\nand developed
                various techniques commonly credited to Laplace.\nHis two most famous theorems of number theory,\nthe
                Law of Quadratic Reciprocity\nand the Three Squares Theorem (a difficult extension of Lagrange\'s\nFour
                Squares Theorem), were each enhanced by Gauss a few years\nafter Legendre\'s work.\nLegendre also proved
                an early version of Bonnet\'s Theorem.\nLegendre\'s work in the theory of equations and\nelliptic
                integrals directly inspired the achievements of Galois and Abel\n(which then obsoleted much of
                Legendre\'s own work);\nChebyshev\'s work also built on Legendre\'s foundations.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Joseph Fourier had a varied career:\nprecocious but mischievous orphan,\ntheology student,
                    young professor of mathematics\n(advancing the theory of equations), then revolutionary
                    activist.\nUnder Napoleon he was a brilliant and important teacher\nand historian; accompanied the
                    French Emperor to Egypt;\nand did excellent service as district governor of Grenoble.\nIn his spare
                    time at Grenoble he continued the work\nin mathematics and physics that led to his
                    immortality.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, Fourier exiled himself to England,\nbut returned to France
                    when offered an important academic\nposition and published his revolutionary treatise on the\nTheory
                    of Heat.\nFourier anticipated linear programming, developing\nthe simplex method and Fourier-Motzkin
                    Elimination;\nand did significant work in operator theory.\nHe is also noted for the notion of
                    dimensional analysis,\nwas first to describe the Greenhouse Effect, and continued\nhis earlier
                    brilliant work with equations.\n\n
            <p>Fourier\'s greatest fame rests on\nhis use of trigonometric series (now called <i>Fourier series</i>)\nin
                the solution of differential equations.\nSince "Fourier" analysis is in extremely common use
                among\napplied mathematicians, he joins the select company of the\neponyms of "Cartesian" coordinates,
                "Gaussian" curve, and\n"Boolean" algebra.\nBecause of the importance of Fourier analysis,\nmany
                listmakers would rank Fourier much higher than I have done;\nhowever the work was not exceptional as <i>pure</i>
                mathematics.\nFourier\'s Heat Equation built on Newton\'s Law of Cooling;\nand the Fourier series
                solution itself\nhad already been introduced by Euler, Lagrange and Daniel Bernoulli.\n\n
            <p>Fourier\'s solution to the heat equation was counterintuitive\n(heat transfer doesn\'t seem to involve
                the oscillations fundamental\nto trigonometric functions): The brilliance of Fourier\'s imagination\nis
                indicated in that the solution had been <i>rejected</i>\nby Lagrange himself.\nAlthough rigorous Fourier
                Theorems were finally proved\nonly by Dirichlet, Riemann and Lebesgue,\nit has been said that it was
                Fourier\'s\n"very disregard for rigor" that led to his great achievement,\nwhich Lord Kelvin compared to

                    only if it is the product of distinct prime Fermat numbers.\n(He didn\'t complete the proof of the

                    Fermat\'s conjecture that every number is\nthe sum of three triangle numbers.\n(He further
                    determined the number of distinct ways such a sum could be formed.)\nAt age 24 he published <i>Disquisitiones
                        Arithmeticae</i>, probably the\ngreatest book of pure mathematics ever.\n\n
            <p>Although he published fewer papers than some other\ngreat mathematicians, Gauss may be the greatest

                Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\n(Unique Prime Factorization) is considered the first rigorous
                proof;\nhe extended this Theorem to the Gaussian (complex) integers;\nand he was first to produce a
                rigorous\nproof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\n(that an n-th degree polynomial has n complex
                roots);\nhis Theorema Egregium ("Remarkable Theorem") that\na surface\'s essential curvature\nderived
                from its 2-D geometry laid the foundation of differential geometry.\nGauss himself used "Fundamental
                Theorem" to refer to \nEuler\'s Law of Quadratic Reciprocity; Gauss was first to provide\na proof for
                this, and provided eight distinct proofs for it\nover the years.\nGauss proved the n=3 case of Fermat\'s
                Last Theorem for Eisenstein\nintegers (the triangular lattice-points on the complex plane);\nthough more
                general, Gauss\' proof was simpler than the real integer proof;\nthis simplification method
                revolutionized algebra.\nHe also found a simpler proof for Fermat\'s Christmas Theorem, by
                taking\nadvantage of the identity <b>x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> = (x + iy)(x - iy)</b>.\nOther work by
                Gauss led to fundamental theorems in statistics, vector\nanalysis, function theory, and generalizations
                of\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\n
            <p>Gauss built the theory of complex numbers into its modern form, including\nthe notion of "monogenic"
                functions\nwhich are now ubiquitous in mathematical physics.\n(Constructing the regular 17-gon as a
                teenager was actually an\nexercise in complex-number algebra, not geometry.)\nGauss developed the
                arithmetic of congruences and became\nthe premier number theoretician of all time.\nOther contributions
                of Gauss include\nhypergeometric series,\nfoundations of statistics, and differential geometry.\nHe also

                Laplace, one of the most\nrespected mathematicians of the time, declared it impossible.\nGauss became

                procedure for rapid calculation of Fourier series,\nand even the rudiments of knot theory.\nGauss was
                first to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Functions of\na Complex Variable (that the line-integral over
                a closed\ncurve of a monogenic function is zero),\nbut he let Cauchy take the credit.\nGauss was very
                prolific, and may be the most\nbrilliant theorem prover who ever lived, so many would rank him #1.\nBut
                several others on the list had more <i>historical</i> importance.\nAbel hints at a reason for

                mathematics (consider Newton\'s Fundamental Theorem\nof Calculus); Abel developed this
                insight.\nLegendre had spent much of his life studying elliptic integrals,\nbut Abel inverted these to
                get elliptic functions,\nand was first to observe (but in a manuscript mislaid by\nCauchy) that they
                were doubly periodic.\nElliptic functions quickly became a productive field of mathematics,\nand led to
                more general complex-variable functions,\nwhich were important to the development of\nboth abstract and
                applied mathematics.\n\n
            <p>Finding the roots of polynomials is a key mathematical\nproblem: the general solution of the quadratic
                equation was\nknown by ancients; the discovery of general methods for\nsolving polynomials of degree
                three and four is usually treated\nas the major math achievement of the 16th century; so\nfor over two
                centuries\nan algebraic solution for the general 5th-degree polynomial\n(quintic) was a Holy
                Grail\nsought by most of the greatest mathematicians.\nAbel proved that most quintics did <i>not</i>
                have such solutions.\nThis discovery, at the age of only nineteen, would have quickly\nawed the world,
                but Abel was impoverished, had few contacts,\nand spoke no German.\nWhen Gauss received Abel\'s
                manuscript he discarded it\nunread, assuming the unfamiliar author was just another crackpot trying
                to\nsquare the circle or some such.\nHis genius was too great for him to be ignored long,\nbut, still
                impoverished,\nAbel died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-six.\nHis fame lives on and even the
                lower-case word\n\'abelian\' is applied to several concepts.\nLiouville said Abel was the greatest
                genius he ever met.\nHermite said "Abel has left mathematicians enough to keep them busy\nfor 500
                years."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    complex variables,\nand did work in number theory\n(e.g. cubic reciprocity) which excited Carl
                    Gauss.\nHe is sometimes described as the successor to Gauss.\nAs an algorist (manipulator of
                    involved algebraic expressions),\nhe may have been surpassed only by Euler and Ramanujan.\nHe was
                    also a very highly regarded teacher.\nIn mathematical physics, Jacobi perfected
                    Hamilton\'s\nprinciple of stationary action, and made other important advances.\n\n
            <p>Jacobi\'s most significant early achievement was the theory\nof elliptic functions, e.g. his fundamental
                result about\nfunctions with multiple periods.\nJacobi was the first to apply elliptic functions to
                number theory,\nextending Lagrange\'s famous Four-Squares Theorem to show\nin <i>how many distinct
                    ways</i>\na given integer can be expressed as the sum of four squares.\nHe also made important
                discoveries in many other areas including\ntheta functions (e.g. his Jacobi Triple Product
                Identity),\nhigher fields, number theory, algebraic geometry,\ndifferential equations, q-series,
                hypergeometric series,\ndeterminants, Abelian functions, and dynamics.\nHe devised the algorithms still

                suggested by the fact that the\n"Hungarian method," an efficient solution to an optimization\nproblem
                published more than a century after Jacobi\'s death,\nhas since been found among Jacobi\'s papers.\n\n
            <p>Like Abel, as a young man\nJacobi attempted to factor the general quintic equation.\nUnlike Abel, he
                seems never to have considered proving its\nimpossibility.\nThis fact is sometimes cited to show that

                <blockquote>Dirichlet was preeminent in algebraic and analytic\nnumber theory, but did advanced work in
                    several other fields as well:\nHe discovered the modern definition of function,\nthe Voronoi diagram
                    of geometry, and important concepts in\ndifferential equations, topology, and statistics.\nHis
                    proofs were noted both for great ingenuity and unprecedented rigor.\nAs an example of his careful
                    rigor, he found a fundamental flaw\nin Steiner\'s Isoperimetric Theorem proof which no one else had
                    noticed.\nIn addition to his own discoveries, Dirichlet played a key role in\ninterpreting the work
                    of Gauss,\nand was an influential teacher,\nmentoring famous mathematicians like\nBernhard Riemann
                    (who considered Dirichlet second only to Gauss\namong living mathematicians),\nLeopold Kronecker and
                    Gotthold Eisenstein.\n\n
            <p>As an impoverished lad Dirichlet spent his money on\nmath textbooks; Gauss\' masterwork became his
                life-long companion.\nFermat and Euler had proved the impossibility of\n<b>x<sup>k</sup> + y<sup>k</sup>
                    = z<sup>k</sup></b>\nfor k = 4 and k = 3; Dirichlet became\nfamous by proving impossibility for k =
                5 at the age of 20.\nLater he proved the case k = 14 and, later still, may have helped\nKummer extend
                Dirichlet\'s quadratic fields, leading to proofs of\nmore cases.\nMore important than his work with
                Fermat\'s Last Theorem\nwas his Unit Theorem, considered one of the most important\ntheorems of
                algebraic number theory.\nThe Unit Theorem is unusually difficult to prove;\nit is said that Dirichlet
                discovered the proof while listening to music\nin the Sistine Chapel.\nA key step in the proof uses <i>Dirichlet\'s
                    Pigeonhole Principle</i>,\na trivial idea but which Dirichlet applied with great ingenuity.\n\n
            <p>Dirichlet did seminal work in analysis and is\nconsidered the founder of analytic number theory.\nHe
                invented a method of L-series to prove the important\ntheorem (Gauss\' conjecture)\nthat any arithmetic
                series (without a common factor) has an\ninfinity of primes.\nIt was Dirichlet who proved the
                fundamental Theorem of Fourier\nseries: that periodic analytic functions\ncan always be represented as a
                simple\ntrigonometric series.\nAlthough he never proved it rigorously, he is especially noted\nfor the
                <i>Dirichlet\'s Principle</i> which posits the existence\nof certain solutions in the calculus of
                variations,\nand which Riemann found to be particularly fruitful.\nOther fundamental results Dirichlet
                contributed to analysis and\nnumber theory include\na theorem about Diophantine approximations\nand his
                <i>Class Number Formula</i>.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>Hamilton was a childhood prodigy.\nHome-schooled and self-taught,\nhe started as a student
                    of languages and literature,\nwas influenced by an arithmetic prodigy his own age,\nread Euclid,
                    Newton and Lagrange, found an error\nby Laplace, and made new discoveries in optics;\nall this
                    before the age of seventeen when he first\nattended school.\nAt college he enjoyed unprecedented
                    success\nin all fields, but his\nundergraduate days were cut short abruptly by his\nappointment as
                    Royal Astronomer of Ireland at the age of 22.\nHe soon began publishing his revolutionary treatises
                    on optics,\nin which he developed Hamilton\'s Principle of Stationary Action.\nThis Principle
                    refined and corrected the earlier principles of\nleast action developed by Maupertuis, Fermat, and
                    Euler;\nit (and related principles) are key to much of modern physics.\nHis early writing also
                    predicted that some crystals would have an hitherto\nunknown "conical" refraction mode; this was
                    soon confirmed experimentally.\n\n
            <p>Hamilton\'s Principle of Least Action, and its associated equations\nand concept of configuration space,
                led to\na revolution in mathematical physics.\nSince Maupertuis had named this Principle a
                century\nearlier, it is possible to underestimate Hamilton\'s contribution.\nHowever Maupertuis, along
                with others credited with anticipating\nthe idea (Fermat, Leibniz, Euler and Lagrange) failed to\nstate
                the full Principle correctly.\nRather than minimizing action, physical systems sometimes achieve\na
                non-minimal but <i>stationary</i> action in configuration space.\n(Poisson and d\' Alembert had noticed
                exceptions to Euler-Lagrange\nleast action, but failed to find Hamilton\'s solution.\nJacobi also
                deserves some credit for the Principle, but his\nwork came after reading Hamilton.)\nBecause of this
                Principle, as well as his wave-particle duality\n(which would be further developed by Planck\nand
                Einstein), Hamilton\ncan be considered a major early influence on quantum theory.\n\n
            <p>Hamilton also made revolutionary contributions\nto dynamics, differential equations, the theory of
                equations,\nnumerical analysis, fluctuating functions,\nand graph theory (he marketed a puzzle based on
                his <i>Hamiltonian paths</i>).\nHe invented the ingenious hodograph.\nHe coined several mathematical
                terms including\n<i>vector</i>, <i>scalar</i>, <i>associative</i>, and <i>tensor</i>.\nIn addition to
                his brilliance and creativity, Hamilton was\nrenowned for thoroughness and produced voluminous
                writings\non several subjects.\n\n
            <p>Hamilton himself considered his greatest accomplishment\nto be the development of quaternions, a
                non-Abelian field to\nhandle 3-D rotations.\nWhile there is no 3-D analog to the\nGaussian
                complex-number plane\n(based on the equation &nbsp; <b><i>i</i><sup>2</sup> = -1</b> &nbsp;),\nquaternions
                derive from a 4-D analog based on\n&nbsp; <b><i>i</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>j</i><sup>2</sup>
                    =\n<i>k</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>ijk</i> = -<i>jik</i> = -1</b>.\nAlthough matrix and tensor methods may
                seem more general,\nquaternions are still in wide engineering use because of\npractical advantages, e.g.
                avoidance of "gimbal lock."\n\n
            <p>Hamilton once wrote:\n"On earth there is nothing great but man;\nin man there is nothing great but
                mind."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    also did advanced work in crystallography, electricity, botany,\nfolklore, and also wrote on
                    political subjects.\nHe had little formal training in mathematics, yet single-handedly

            <p>Of his linear algebra, one historian wrote "few have come closer than\nHermann Grassmann to creating,

                    later).\nHe invented Liouville integrability and fractional calculus;\nhe found a new proof of the

                mathematical terms (e.g. <i>matrix</i>,\n<i>invariant</i>, <i>discriminant</i>, <i>covariant</i>, <i>syzygy</i>,\n<i>graph</i>,
                <i>Jacobian</i>)\nthan anyone except Leibniz.\nSylvester was especially noted for the broad range of his
                mathematics\nand his ingenious methods.\nHe solved (or partially solved) a huge variety of rich
                puzzles\nincluding various geometric gems;\nthe enumeration of polynomial roots first tackled
                by\nDescartes and Newton; and, by advancing the theory of\npartitions, the system of equations\nposed by
                Euler as <i>The Problem of the Virgins</i>.\nSylvester was also a linguist, a poet, and did work in
                mechanics (inventing\nthe skew pantograph) and optics.\nHe once wrote, "May not music be described as

                    concept\nof uniform convergence, and was\nthen able to prove several fundamental but
                    hitherto\nunproven theorems.\nStarting strictly from the integers,\nhe also applied his axiomatic
                    methods to a definition\nof irrational numbers.\nHe developed important new insights in other
                    fields\nincluding the calculus of variations, elliptic functions, and trigonometry.\nWeierstrass
                    shocked his colleagues when he demonstrated\na continuous function which is differentiable
                    nowhere.\n(Both this and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem were rediscoveries\nof forgotten results by
                    the under-published Bolzano.)\nHe found simpler proofs of many existing theorems, including\nGauss\'
                    Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and the fundamental Hermite-Lindemann\nTranscendence
                    Theorem.\nSteiner\'s proof of the Isoperimetric Theorem contained a flaw,\nso Weierstrass became the
                    first to supply a fully rigorous\nproof of that famous and ancient result.\nPeter Dirichlet was a
                    champion of rigor, but Weierstrass\ndiscovered a flaw in the argument for\nDirichlet\'s Principle of
                    of variational calculus.\n\n
            <p>Weierstrass demonstrated extreme brilliance as a youth,\nbut during his college years he detoured into
                drinking and dueling\nand ended up as a degreeless secondary school teacher.\nDuring this time he
                studied Abel\'s papers, developed results\nin elliptic and Abelian functions, proved\nthe Laurent
                expansion theorem before Laurent did, and\nindependently proved the Fundamental Theorem of Functions
                of\na Complex Variable.\nHe was interested in power series and felt that others\nhad overlooked the
                importance of Abel\'s Theorem.\nEventually one of his papers was published in a journal;\nhe was
                immediately given an honorary doctorate\nand was soon regarded as one of the best and
                most\ninspirational mathematicians in the world.\nHis insistence on absolutely rigorous proofs
                equaled\nor exceeded even that of Cauchy, Abel and Dirichlet.\nHis students included Kovalevskaya,
                Frobenius, Mittag-Leffler,\nand several other famous mathematicians.\nBell called him "probably the
                greatest mathematical teacher of all time."\nIn 1873 Hermite called Weierstrass "the Master of all of
                us."\nToday he is often called the "Father of Modern Analysis."\n\n

                    gradually developed his math skills; as a young man\nhe published a paper on the calculus of

                    mathematics he pioneered will\nseem like an exaggeration.\nIn addition to being very inventive,\nhe
                    was an excellent algorist; some considered him\nto be the greatest mathematician of the late 19th
                    century\n(an era that includes Weierstrass and Poincar&eacute;).\nCayley was the essential founder
                    of modern group theory,\nmatrix algebra, the theory of higher singularities,\nand higher-dimensional
                    geometry\n(building on Pl&uuml;cker\'s work and anticipating the ideas of Klein),\nas well as the
                    theory of invariants.\nAmong his many important theorems are\nthe Cayley-Hamilton Theorem,\nand
                    Cayley\'s Theorem itself\n(that any group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a symmetric group).\nHe
                    extended Hamilton\'s quaternions and developed the octonions,\nbut was still one of the first to
                    realize that these special\nalgebras could often be subsumed by general matrix
                    methods.\n(Hamilton\'s friend John T. Graves independently discovered the\noctonions about the same
                    time as Cayley did.)\nHe also did original research in combinatorics (e.g. enumeration of
                    trees),\nelliptic and Abelian functions,\nand projective geometry.\nOne of his famous geometric
                    theorems is a generalization of\nPascal\'s Mystic Hexagram result; another resulted in an
                    elegant\nproof of the Quadratic Reciprocity law.\n\n
            <p>Cayley may have been the <i>least</i> eccentric\nof the great mathematicians:\nIn addition to\nhis
                life-long love of mathematics, he enjoyed hiking,\npainting, reading fiction, and had a happy married
                life.\nHe easily won Smith\'s Prize and Senior Wrangler at Cambridge,\nbut then worked as a lawyer for
                many years.\nHe later became professor,\nand finished his career in the limelight as\nPresident of the
                British Association for the Advancement of Science.\nHe and James Joseph Sylvester\nwere a source of
                inspiration to each other.\nThese two, along with Charles Hermite, are considered the\nfounders of the
                important theory of invariants.\nThough applied first to algebra, the notion of invariants\nis useful in
                many areas of mathematics.\n\n

                <blockquote>Hermite studied the works of Lagrange\nand Gauss from an early age and soon developed an

                    Galois and\nalso had trouble passing their examinations, but soon became\nhighly respected by
                    Europe\'s best mathematicians for his\nsignificant advances in analytic number theory, elliptic
                    functions,\nand quadratic forms.\nAlong with Cayley and Sylvester,\nhe founded the important theory
                    of invariants.\nHermite\'s theory of transformation allowed him to connect\nanalysis, algebra and
                    number theory in novel ways.\nHe was a kindly modest man and an inspirational teacher.\nAmong his
                    students was Poincar&eacute;, who said of Hermite, "He never\nevokes a concrete image, yet you soon
                    perceive that the more\nabstract entities are to him like living creatures....\nMethods always
                    seemed to be born in his mind in some mysterious way."\nHermite\'s other famous students included
                    Darboux, Borel, and\nHadamard who wrote of "how magnificent Hermite\'s teaching was,\noverflowing
                    with enthusiasm for science, which seemed to come to life\nin his voice and whose beauty he never
                    failed to communicate to us,\nsince he felt it so much himself to the very depth of his being."\n\n
            <p>Although he and Abel had proved that the general quintic lacked\nalgebraic solutions, Hermite introduced
                an elliptic analog to the\ncircular trigonometric functions and used these to provide\na general
                solution for the quintic equation.\nHe developed the concept of complex conjugate which is
                now\nubiquitous in mathematical physics and matrix theory.\nHe was first to prove that the Stirling\nand
                Euler generalizations of the factorial function are equivalent.\nHe was first to note remarkable facts
                about Heegner numbers, e.g.\n<br><big><b>&nbsp; <i>e</big><sup><big>&pi;</big>&radic;163</sup></i></b> =
                262537412640768743.9999999999992...\n<br>(Without computers he was able to calculate this
                number,\nincluding the twelve 9\'s to the right of the decimal point.)\nVery many elegant concepts and
                theorems are named after Hermite.\nHermite\'s most famous result may be his intricate proof\nthat <b><i>e</i></b>
                (along with a broad class\nof related numbers) is transcendental.\n(Extending the proof to <b>&pi;</b>
                was left to Lindemann,\na matter of regret for historians, some of whom who regard Hermite as
                the\ngreatest mathematician of his era.)\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    he made\nrevolutionary contributions in many areas of pure mathematics,\nand also inspired the
                    development of physics.\nHe had poor physical health and died at an early age, yet is

                    advances in complex analysis, which he connected to\nboth topology and number theory.\nHe applied

                    manifolds Riemann invented\ndifferential geometry and took non-Euclidean geometry far\nbeyond his
                    predecessors.\nRiemann\'s other masterpieces include tensor analysis,\nthe theory of functions, and
                    a key relationship between\nsome differential equation solutions and hypergeometric series.\nHis
                    generalized notions of distance and curvature\ndescribed new possibilities for the geometry of space
                    itself.\nSeveral important theorems and concepts are named\nafter Riemann, e.g. the Riemann-Roch
                    Theorem, a key connection\namong topology, complex analysis and algebraic geometry.\nHe proved
                    Riemann\'s Rearrangement Theorem, a strong (and paradoxical)\nresult about conditionally convergent
                    series.\nHe was also first to prove theorems named after others, e.g. Green\'s Theorem.\nHe was so
                    prolific and original that some of his work\nwent unnoticed (for example, Weierstrass became famous
                    for showing\na nowhere-differentiable continuous function;\nlater it was found that Riemann had
                    casually mentioned one\nin a lecture years earlier).\nLike his mathematical peers (Gauss,
                    Archimedes, Newton), Riemann\nwas intensely interested in physics.\nHis theory unifying electricity,
                    magnetism and light was\nsupplanted by Maxwell\'s theory; however modern physics, beginning\nwith
                    Einstein\'s relativity, relies on Riemann\'s\ncurvature tensor and other notions of the geometry of
                    space.\n\n
            <p>Riemann\'s teacher was Carl Gauss, who helped steer the young\ngenius towards pure mathematics. Gauss
                selected "On the hypotheses\nthat Lie at the Foundations of Geometry" as Riemann\'s first lecture;\nwith
                this famous lecture Riemann went far beyond Gauss\' initial effort\nin differential geometry, extended
                it to multiple dimensions, and\nintroduced the new and important theory of differential manifolds.\nFive
                years later, to celebrate his election to the Berlin Academy,\nRiemann presented a lecture "On the
                Number of Prime Numbers Less\nThan a Given Quantity," for which "Number" he presented and\npartially
                proved an <i>exact</i> formula, albeit weirdly complicated.\nNumerous papers have been written on the
                distribution of primes,\nbut Riemann\'s contribution is incomparable, despite that\nhis Berlin Academy
                lecture was his only paper ever on the topic,\nand number theory was far from his specialty.\nIn the
                lecture he posed the <i>Hypothesis of Riemann\'s zeta function</i>,\nneeded for the missing step in his
                proof.\nThis Hypothesis is considered the most important and famous unsolved problem\nin

                <blockquote>Henry Smith (born in Ireland) was one of the greatest number theorists,\nworking especially
                    with elementary divisors; he also advanced\nthe theory of quadratic forms.\nA famous problem of
                    Eisenstein was, given <b><i>n</i></b>\nand <b><i>k</i></b>, in how many different ways can
                    <b><i>n</i></b>\nbe expressed as the sum of <b><i>k</i></b> squares?\nSmith made great progress on
                    this problem, subsuming special \ncases which had earlier been famous theorems.\nAlthough most noted
                    for number theory, he had great breadth.\nHe did prize-winning work in geometry, discovered the
                    unique normal form\nfor matrices which now bears his name, anticipated specific fractals\nincluding
                    the Cantor set, the Sierpinski gasket and the Koch snowflake,\nand wrote a paper demonstrating the
                    limitations of Riemann integration.\n
            <p>Smith is sometimes called "the mathematician the world forgot."\nHis paper on integration could have led
                directly\nto measure theory and Lebesgue integration, but was ignored for decades.\nThe fractals he
                discovered are named after people who rediscovered them.\nThe Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula of
                lattice theory would be\ncalled just the Smith formula, but had to be rediscovered.\nAnd his solution to
                the Eisenstein five-squares problem, buried \nin his voluminous writings on number theory, was
                ignored:\nthis "unsolved" problem was featured for a prize which Minkowski won\ntwo decades later!\n
            <p>Henry Smith was an outstanding intellect with a modest\nand charming personality.\nHe was knowledgeable
                in a broad range of fields unrelated\nto mathematics; his University even insisted he run for
                Parliament.\nHis love of mathematics didn\'t depend on utility: he once wrote\n"Pure mathematics: may it
                never be of any use to anyone."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                <blockquote>At the age of 14, Maxwell published a remarkable paper\non the construction of ovals;\nthese
                    were an independent discovery of the <i>Ovals of Descartes</i>,\nbut Maxwell allowed more than two
                    foci, had elaborate configurations\n(he was drawing the ovals with string and pencil), and
                    identified\nerrors in Descartes\' treatment of them.\nHis genius was soon renowned throughout
                    Scotland, with the future Lord Kelvin\nremarking that Maxwell\'s "lively imagination started so many
                    hares that\nbefore he had run one down he was off on another."\nHe did a comprehensive analysis of
                    Saturn\'s rings; developed\nthe important kinetic theory of gases; explored elasticity,
                    viscosity,\nknot theory, topology, soap bubbles, and more.\nHe introduced the "Maxwell\'s Demon" as
                    a thought experiment for thermodynamics;\nhis paper "On Governors" effectively founded the field of
                    cybernetics;\nhe advanced the theory of color, and produced the first color photograph.\nOne
                    Professor said of him, "there is scarcely a single topic that\nhe touched upon, which he did not
                    change almost beyond recognition."\nMaxwell was also a poet.\n
            <p>Maxwell did little of importance in pure mathematics, so\nhis great creativity in mathematical physics
                might not seem enough to\nqualify him for this list,\nalthough his contribution to the kinetic theory of
                gases\n(which even led to the first estimate of molecular sizes) would\nalready be enough to make him
                one of the greatest physicists.\nBut then, in 1864 James Clerk Maxwell stunned the world by\npublishing
                the equations of electricity and magnetism,\npredicting the existence of radio waves and that light
                itself\nis a form of such waves and is thus linked to the electro-magnetic force.\nRichard Feynman
                considered this the most significant event of\nthe 19th century (though others might give higher billing
                to\nDarwin\'s theory of evolution).\nAlong with Einstein, Newton, Galileo and Archimedes,\nMaxwell would
                be a frequent choice for a Five Greatest Scientists list.\nRecalling Newton\'s comment about "standing
                on the shoulders" of\nearlier greats, Einstein was asked whose shoulders <i>he</i>\nstood on; he didn\'t
                name Newton: he said "Maxwell."\nMaxwell has been called the "Father of Modern Physics"; he ranks #24

                    and algebraic number theory\nas well as mathematical foundations.\nHe was one of the first to pursue
                    Galois Theory, making major advances there\nand pioneering in the application of group theory to
                    other branches\nof mathematics.\nDedekind also invented a system of fundamental axioms for
                    arithmetic,\nworked in probability theory and complex analysis,\nand invented prime partitions and

                    Kummer had begun this, but\nDedekind gave it a more abstract and productive basis,\nwhich was
                    developed further by Hilbert, Noether and Weil.\nThough the term <i>ring</i> itself was coined by
                    Hilbert,\nDedekind introduced the terms <i>module</i>, <i>field</i>, and <i>ideal</i>.\nDedekind was
                    far ahead of his time, so Noether became famous\nas the creator of modern algebra; but she
                    acknowledged her great predecessor,\nfrequently saying "It is all already in Dedekind."\n\n
            <p>Dedekind was concerned with rigor, writing\n"nothing capable of proof ought to be accepted without
                proof."\nBefore him, the real numbers, continuity, and infinity all\nlacked rigorous definitions.\nThe
                axioms Dedekind invented allow the integers and rational\nnumbers to be built and his <i>Dedekind
                    Cut</i> then led to a rigorous\nand useful definition of the real numbers.\nDedekind was a key
                mentor for Georg Cantor:\nhe introduced the notion that a bijection implied equinumerosity,\nused this
                to define infinitude (a set is infinite if\nequinumerous with its proper subset),\nand was first to
                prove the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr&ouml;der Theorem,\nthough he didn\'t publish his proof.\n(Because he

                    work has been called the greatest advance in logic since Aristotle.\nHe introduced the essential
                    notion of <i>quantifiers</i>; he distinguished\nterms from predicates, and simple predicates from
                    2nd-level predicates.\nFrom his second-order logic he defined numbers, and derived\nthe axioms of
                    arithmetic with what is now called Frege\'s Theorem.\nHis work was largely underappreciated at the
                    time, partly \nbecause of his clumsy notation, partly because his system\nwas published with a flaw
                    (Russell\'s antinomy).\n(Bertrand Russell reports that when he informed him of this flaw,
                    Frege\ntook it with incomparable integrity, grace, and even intellectual pleasure.)\nFrege and
                    Cantor were the era\'s outstanding foundational theorists;\nunfortunately their relationship with
                    each other became bitter.\nDespite all this, Frege\'s work influenced Peano, Russell,
                    Wittgenstein\nand others; and he is now often called the greatest\nmathematical logician ever.\n
            <p>Frege also did work in geometry and differential equations;\nand, in order to construct the real numbers
                with his set theory,\nproved an important new theorem of group theory.\nHe was also an important
                philosopher, and wrote "Every good mathematician\nis at least half a philosopher, and every good
                philosopher is at least\nhalf a mathematician."\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    introducing the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation,\nshowed that atoms\' discreteness explained Brownian
                    motion.\nAnother 1905 paper introduced the famous equation\n<b>E = mc<sup>2</sup></b>; yet Einstein
                    published other papers\nthat same year, two of which were more important and influential\nthan
                    either of the two just mentioned.\nNo wonder that physicists speak of the <i>Miracle Year</i>\nwithout
                    bothering to qualify it as <i>Einstein\'s Miracle Year</i>!\n(Before his Miracle Year, Einstein had
                    been a mediocre\nundergraduate, and held minor jobs including patent\nexaminer.)\nAltogether
                    Einstein published at least 300 books or papers on physics.\nFor example, in a 1917 paper he
                    anticipated the principle of the laser.\nAlso, sometimes in collaboration with Leo Szilard, he was
                    co-inventor of\nseveral devices, including a gyroscopic compass,\nhearing aid, automatic camera and,
                    most famously,\nthe Einstein-Szilard refrigerator.\nHe became a very famous and influential public
                    figure.\n(For example, it was his letter that led Roosevelt to start\nthe Manhattan Project.)\nAmong
                    his many famous quotations is:\n"The search for truth is more precious than its possession."\n\n
            <p>Einstein is most famous for his Special and General Theories\nof Relativity, but he should be considered
                the key pioneer of\nQuantum Theory as well, drawing inferences from Planck\'s work that\nno one else
                dared to draw.\nIndeed it was his articulation of the quantum principle in a 1905 paper\nwhich has been
                called\n"the most revolutionary sentence written by a physicist of the\ntwentieth century."\nEinstein\'s
                discovery of the photon in that paper led to his only Nobel Prize;\nyears later, he was first to call
                attention to the "spooky"\nnature of quantum entanglement.\nEinstein was also first to call attention to
                a flaw in Weyl\'s\nearliest unified field theory.\nBut despite the importance of his other contributions
                it is Einstein\'s\nGeneral Theory which is his most profound contribution.\nMinkowski had developed a
                flat 4-dimensional space-time to \ncope with Einstein\'s Special Theory; but it was Einstein\nwho had
                the vision to add curvature to that space\nto describe acceleration.\n\n
            <p>Einstein certainly has the breadth, depth, and historical importance\nto qualify for this list; but his
                genius and significance were not in\nthe field of pure mathematics.\n(He acknowledged his limitation,
                writing\n"I admire the elegance of your [Levi-Civita\'s] method of computation;\nit must be nice to ride
                through these fields upon the horse of\ntrue mathematics while the like of us have\nto make our way
                laboriously on foot.")\nEinstein <i>was</i> a mathematician, however;\nhe pioneered the application of
                tensor calculus to physics\nand invented the <i>Einstein summation notation</i>.\nThat Einstein\'s
                Equation of General Relativity explained a discrepancy\nin Mercury\'s orbit was a discovery made by
                Einstein personally\n(a discovery he described as \'joyous excitement\' that gave\nhim heart
                palpitations).\nHe composed a beautiful essay about mathematical proofs\nusing the Theorem of Menelaus

            <p>Intuitionism has had a significant influence,\nalthough few strict adherents.\nSince only constructive

                discovery of gauge invariance and notion of Riemann\nsurfaces form the basis of modern physics; he was
                also\na creative thinker in philosophy.\nWeyl excelled at many fields of mathematics including integral

                theory), and\ntheoretical physics (e.g., Weyl tensor, gauge field theory and invariance).\nHis theorems
                include key lemmas and foundational results in several fields;\nAtiyah commented that whenever\nhe
                explored a new topic he found that Weyl had preceded him.\nAlthough he was a master of algebra, he
                revealed his philosophic\npreference by\nwriting "In these days the angel of topology and the devil of
                abstract\nalgebra fight for the soul of every individual discipline of mathematics."\nFor a while, Weyl
                was a disciple of Brouwer\'s Intuitionism and\nhelped advance that doctrine, but he eventually found it
                too restrictive.\nWeyl was also a very influential figure in all three major fields\nof 20th-century

                Julian Schwinger, himself considered an\ninscrutable genius, was so impressed by Weyl\'s book
                connecting\nquantum physics to group theory that he likened Weyl to a "god"\nbecause "the ways of gods
                are mysterious, inscrutable, and\nbeyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals."\nWeyl once wrote: "My

                tremendous span of his career is suggested by the fact\nthat he won Smith\'s Prize (and Senior Wrangler)
                in 1905\nand the Copley Medal in 1958.\nHe specialized in analysis and analytic number theory\nbut also
                did important work in combinatorics, Fourier theory,\nDiophantine approximations, differential

                while true for most, and all but\nvery large, numbers, are violated infinitely often.\n(Building on this

                    mathematical peers, and suffered\nfrom poverty: childhood dysentery and vitamin deficiencies
                    probably led\nto his early death.\nYet he produced 4000 theorems or conjectures in number
                    theory,\nalgebra, and combinatorics.\nWhile some of these were old theorems or just
                    curiosities,\nmany were brilliant new theorems with very difficult proofs.\nFor example, he found a
                    beautiful identity connecting\nPoisson summation to the M&ouml;bius function.\nHe also found a
                    brilliant generalization of Lagrange\'s\nFour Square Theorem; and much more.\nRamanujan might be
                    almost unknown today, except that\nhis letter caught the eye of Godfrey Hardy, who saw\nremarkable,
                    almost inexplicable formulae which\n"must be true, because if they were not true, no one would\nhave
                    had the imagination to invent them."\nRamanujan\'s specialties included infinite series,\nelliptic
                    functions, continued fractions,\npartition enumeration, definite integrals, modular equations,\nthe
                    divisor function,\ngamma functions, "mock theta" functions, hypergeometric series,\nand "highly
                    composite" numbers.\nRamanujan\'s "Master Theorem" has wide application in analysis,\nand has been
                    applied to the evaluation of Feynman diagrams.\nMuch of his best work was done in collaboration with
                    Hardy, for example\na proof that almost all numbers <i>n</i> have about <i>log log n</i>\nprime
                    factors (a result which developed into probabilistic number theory).\nMuch of his methodology,
                    including unusual ideas about divergent series,\nwas his own invention.\n(As a young man he made the
                    absurd claim that <b>1+2+3+4+... = -1/12</b>.\nLater it was noticed that this claim translates to a
                    true statement\nabout the Riemann zeta function, with which Ramanujan was unfamiliar.)\nRamanujan\'s
                    innate ability for algebraic manipulations equaled or surpassed\nthat of Euler and Jacobi.\n\n
            <p>Ramanujan\'s most famous work was with the partition enumeration\nfunction <i>p()</i>, Hardy guessing
                that some of these discoveries would have\nbeen delayed at least a century without Ramanujan.\nTogether,
                Hardy and Ramanujan developed an analytic approximation to\n<i>p()</i>, although Hardy was initially
                awed by Ramanujan\'s intuitive\ncertainty about the existence of such a formula,\nand even the form it
                would have.\n(Rademacher and Selberg later discovered an exact\nexpression to replace the

                anticipated their technique, but had\ndeferred to his friend and mentor.)\n\n
            <p>In a letter from his deathbed, Ramanujan introduced his mysterious\n"mock theta functions",\ngave
                examples, and developed their properties.\nMuch later these forms began to appear in disparate
                areas:\ncombinatorics, the proof of Fermat\'s Last Theorem, and even\nknot theory and the theory of
                black holes.\nIt was only recently, more than 80 years after Ramanujan\'s letter,\nthat his
                conjectures\nabout these functions were proven; solutions mathematicians had sought\nunsuccessfully were
                found among his examples.\nMathematicians are baffled that Ramanujan could make these\nconjectures,
                which they confirmed only with difficulty using methods\nnot available in Ramanujan\'s day.\n\n
            <p>Many of Ramanujan\'s results\nare so inspirational that there is a periodical dedicated to them.\nThe
                theories of strings and crystals have benefited from Ramanujan\'s work.\n(Today some professors achieve
                fame just by finding\na new proof for one of Ramanujan\'s many results.)\nUnlike Abel, who insisted on
                rigorous proofs, Ramanujan\noften omitted proofs.\n(Ramanujan may have had unrecorded proofs, poverty
                leading him to\nuse chalk and erasable slate rather than paper.)\nUnlike Abel, much of whose work
                depended on the complex\nnumbers, most of Ramanujan\'s work focused on real numbers.\nDespite these
                limitations, some consider Ramanujan to be the\ngreatest mathematical genius ever; but he ranks as low
                as #17\nsince many lesser mathematicians were much more influential.\n\n
            <p>Because of its fast convergence, an odd-looking formula of Ramanujan is\nsometimes used to calculate <b>&pi;</b>:\n<br>\n&nbsp;

                <blockquote>G&ouml;del, who had the nickname <i>Herr Warum</i> ("Mr. Why")\nas a child, was perhaps the
                    foremost logic theorist\never, clarifying the relationships between various modes\nof logic. He
                    partially resolved both Hilbert\'s 1st and 2nd Problems,\nthe latter with a proof so remarkable that
                    it was connected to the\ndrawings of Escher and music of Bach in the title of a famous book.\nHe was
                    a close friend of Albert Einstein, and was first to discover\n"paradoxical" solutions (e.g. time
                    travel) to Einstein\'s equations.\nAbout his friend, Einstein later said that he had remained
                    at\nPrinceton\'s Institute for Advanced Study merely\n"to have the privilege of walking home with G&ouml;del."\n(Like
                    a few of the other greatest 20th-century\nmathematicians, G&ouml;del was very eccentric.)\n\n
            <p>Two of the major questions confronting mathematics are:\n(1) are its axioms consistent (its theorems all
                being\ntrue statements)?,\nand (2) are its axioms complete (its true statements all being theorems)?\nG&ouml;del
                turned his attention to these fundamental questions.\nHe proved that first-order logic was indeed <i>complete</i>,
                but that\nthe more powerful axiom systems needed for arithmetic (constructible\nset theory) were
                necessarily <i>incomplete</i>.\nHe also proved that the Axioms of Choice (AC) and the Generalized
                Continuum\nHypothesis (GCH) were <i>consistent</i> with set theory, but that set\ntheory\'s own
                consistency could not be proven.\nHe may have established that the truths of AC and GCH were <i>independent</i>\nof
                the usual set theory axioms, but the proof was left to Paul Cohen.\n\n
            <p>In G&ouml;del\'s famous proof of Incompleteness,\nhe exhibits a true statement (<b>G</b>) which\ncannot
                be proven, to wit\n"<i><b>G</b> (this statement itself) cannot be proven.</i>"\nIf <b>G</b> could be
                proven it would be a contradictory\ntrue statement, so consistency dictates that it indeed <i>cannot</i>\nbe
                proven. But that\'s what <b>G</b> says, so <b>G</b> is true!\nThis sounds like mere word play, but
                building from ordinary logic\nand arithmetic G&ouml;del was able to construct statement <b>G</b>
                rigorously.\n</blockquote>\n\n

                    Theorem,\nthe Atiyah-Segal Completion Theorem,\nand the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral

                    was a proponent of the recent idea that octonions may\nunderlie particle physics.\nHe also studied

                    restored\na close relationship between leading edge research\nin mathematics and physics.\nHis
                    interest in physics, and an old theory of von Neumann,\nled him, as a very old man, to explore the
                    fine structure\nconstant of physics.\nIn September 2018 he announced that this\nrecent work would
                    lead to a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis\nbut other mathematicians are quite
                    skeptical.\nNonetheless, Michael Atiyah is still regarded as one of the\nvery greatest
                    mathematicians of the 20th century.\n
            <p>Atiyah was known as a vivacious genius in person, inspiring many,\ne.g. Edward Witten.\nAtiyah once said

                    as well as to mathematics, general relativity and\ncosmology.\nSome of his earliest work was done in
                    collaboration with his father Lionel,\na polymath and professor of psychiatry who developed the
                    Penrose Square Root Law of\nvoting theory.\nTogether, Roger and his father discovered the
                    \'impossible tri-bar\' and\nan impossible staircase which inspired work by the artist M.C.
                    Escher.\nAnd, in turn, Escher\'s drawings may have helped inspire Penrose\'s\nmost famous
                    discoveries in recreational mathematics: non-periodic tilings.\nHe soon found such a tiling with
                    just two tile shapes;\nthe previous record was six shapes.\n(Nine years after that, such tilings
                    were observed in nature as "quasi-crystals.")\nPenrose has written several successful popular books
                    on science.\n\n
            <p>As a mathematician, Penrose did important work in algebra: he was first to conceive\nof the generalized
                matrix inverse, and used it for novel solutions in linear\nalgebra and spectral decomposition.\nHe did
                more important work in geometry and topology; for example, he proved\ntheorems about embedding (or
                "unknotting") manifolds in Euclidean space.\nHis best mathematics, e.g. the invention of twistor theory,
                was inspired\nby his pursuit of Einstein\'s general relativity.\n\n
            <p>Penrose is most noted for his very creative work in cosmology, specifically\nin the mathematics of
                gravitation, space-time, black holes and the Big Bang.\nHe developed new methods to apply spinors and
                Riemann tensors to gravitation.\nHis twistor theory was an effort to relate general relativity\nto
                quantum theory; this work advanced both physics and mathematics.\nThe top physicist Kip Thorne said
                "Roger Penrose revolutionized the\nmathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of
                space-time."\nStephen Hawking was an early convert to Penrose\'s methods; the mathematical\nlaws of
                black holes (and the Big Bang)\nare called the Penrose-Hawking Singularity Theorems.\nPenrose formulated
                the Censorship Hypotheses about black holes, e.g. the Riemannian\nPenrose Inequality and the Weyl
                Curvature Hypothesis;\nand discovered Penrose-Terrell rotation.\n\n
            <p>Penrose has proposed <i>conformal cyclic cosmology</i>, that in\nthe entropy death of one universe, the
                scaling of time and distance\nbecome arbitrary and the dying universe becomes the big bang for
                another.\nRecently it is proposed\nthat evidence for this can be seen in the details of\nthe cosmic
                microwave background radiation from the early universe.\nMany of his theories are extremely
                controversial:\nHe claims that G&ouml;del\'s\nIncompleteness Theorem provides insight into human
                consciousness.\nHe has developed a detailed theory that quantum effects (involving\nthe microtubules in

                    quaternions,\ntilings, and cellular automaton theory.\nHe started his career by proving a case of
                    Waring\'s Problem,\nbut achieved fame when he discovered the largest then-known\nsporadic group (the
                    symmetry group of the Leech lattice);\nthis sporadic group is now known to be second in size\nonly
                    to the <i>Monster Group</i>, with which Conway also worked.\nConway\'s fertile creativity has
                    produced a\ncornucopia of fascinating inventions: markable straight-edge\nconstruction of the
                    regular heptagon (a feat also achieved\nby Alhazen, Thabit, Vieta and perhaps Archimedes),\na
                    nowhere-continuous function that has the Intermediate Value property,\nthe Conway box function,\nthe
                    rational tangle theorem in knot theory,\nthe aperiodic pinwheel tiling,\na representation of
                    symmetric polyhedra,\nthe silly but elegant <i>Fractran</i> programming language,\nhis chained-arrow
                    notation for large numbers, and many results and\nconjectures in recreational mathematics.\nHe found
                    the simplest proof for Morley\'s Trisector Theorem (sometimes\ncalled the best result in simple
                    plane geometry since ancient Greece).\nHe proved an unusual theorem about quantum physics:\n"If
                    experimenters have free will, then so do elementary particles."\nHis most famous construction
                    is\nthe computationally complete automaton\nknown as the <i>Game of Life</i>.\nHis most important
                    theoretical invention, however,\nmay be his <i>surreal numbers</i> incorporating infinitesimals;\nhe
                    invented them to solve combinatorial games like Go,\nbut they have pure mathematical significance as
                    the\nlargest possible ordered field.\n
            <p>Conway\'s great creativity and breadth\ncertainly make him one of the greatest living
